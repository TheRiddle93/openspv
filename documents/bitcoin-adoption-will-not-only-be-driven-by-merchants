<p>I wrote that <a href="./ahc/bitcoin-adoption-will-be-driven-by-merchants">last post</a> in haste, but I thought I should add that while merchants will help drive adoption of bitcoin, there are lots of other things that will drive (and already have driven) adoption of bitcoin.
</p>

<p>Speculators have driven the price from nothing to 15 USD.
They believe the bitcoins are undervalued, and thus they create a great deal of demand.
So speculators help drive bitcoin by creating demand.
</p>

<p>Technogeeks who mine drive bitcoin because there are only so many bitcoins to be mined&#8212;50 every ten minutes, approximately.
Other technogeeks may buy into bitcoin for nerdy reasons without mining.
So technogeeks also help drive bitcoin by creating demand.
</p>

<p>Anarchogeeks who like the economic and political implications of bitcoin buy into bitcoin for ideological reasons.
They, too, drive bitcoin by creating demand.</p>

<p>Startup founders who see the opportunities created by bitcoin can create services that use bitcoin that aren&#8217;t possible or practical with centralized fiat currencies.
These people will not be &#8220;merchants&#8221; in the obvious sense of selling a product for bitcoins.
Rather, they will create innovative businesses that are not necessarily like the sorts of businesses that have come before.
So startup founders will drive bitcoin by creating compelling reasons to use it.</p>

<p>Finally, regular merchants, who sell a product for bitcoins, will also drive bitcoin, because they will find the reasons for using bitcoin so compelling that they will be willing to sell their products only for bitcoin, or give special prices for using bitcoin.</p>

<p>For a different analysis on what drives or will drive bitcoin, see the series by Falkvinge: <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/06/16/bitcoins-four-drivers-part-one-unlawful-trade/">1</a>, <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/06/18/bitcoins-four-drivers-part-two-international-trade/">2</a>, <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/07/03/bitcoins-four-drivers-part-3-merchant-trade/">3</a>, <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2011/07/05/bitcoins-four-drivers-part-4-investment/">4</a>.</p>
