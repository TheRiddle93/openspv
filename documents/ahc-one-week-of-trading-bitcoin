<p>
About a week ago I discovered <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">bitcoin</a>, and I&#8217;ve been a little obsessed with it since then.
Bitcoin is a new digital currency that is controlled in a decentralized way on a peer-to-peer network.
One of its most valuable properties is that it is extremely easy to send bitcoins from your account to someone else&#8217;s, without any third-party.
This property, along with the fact that bitcoins are finite, give bitcoins enormous value.
</p>

<p>
Along with deciding to <a href="/ahc/bootstrapping-a-bitcoin-business-part-1-finding-an-idea/">start a bitcoin business</a>, which amounts to investing my time and effort into bitcoin, I&#8217;ve also decided to invest some US dollars in bitcoin.
To do this, you must find someone to trade with.
(I have decided not to mine, at least for the time-being, since it is very expensive to build a sufficiently powerful computer.)
According to <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/mtgoxUSD_depth.html">Bitcoin Charts</a>, <a href="https://mtgox.com/">Mt. Gox</a> is the biggest exchange.
However, getting money into Mt. Gox is not instant, unless you already have a <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/login.aspx">Dwolla</a> account, which I didn&#8217;t.
Therefore, while I was waiting for my funds to transfer to Dwolla, I tried the other popular method of training for bitcoins.
And that is to use <a href="http://bitcoin-otc.com/">#bitcoin-otc</a>.
</p>

<p>#bitcoin-otc is a channel on the freenode IRC network (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode">which is devoted to open-source, &#8220;peer-directed&#8221; software</a>, like bitcoin).
There, many people are hanging around waiting to trade with people.
To trade with them, I signed up for a Premier Paypal account and registered my bank account and credit card.
I also registered my #bitcoin-otc identity using <a href="http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/GPG_authentication">GPG authentication</a>, so that I could participate in the #bitcoin-otc <a href="http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php">web of trust</a>, which is a way of letting everyone rate each other, so you can be sure you&#8217;re dealing with someone who has a soild reputation so that you (probably) don&#8217;t get scammed.</p>

<p>Once I had my Paypal account setup, I was able to begin making trades using my credit card.
Unfortunately, Paypal placed limits on what I was able to do with my credit card; I could not make several trades in a row, or it would remove my ability to pay by credit card.
After a few days, money from my bank account arrived in Paypal, and I was able to make a few trades using that money instead.
Also, there is no fee for using your Paypal balance, but there is a fee for using credit cards.
When you make a payment with a credit card, select &#8220;gift&#8221; if  you want to pay for the fees instead of making the seller pay the fees.
You can see I have achieved a <a href="http://bitcoin-otc.com/viewratingdetail.php?nick=astrohacker">positive rating</a> on the web of trust after a few trades.
</p>

<p>Finally, my money made it into my Dwolla account, which I was then able to transfer into Mt. Gox.
Trading on Mt. Gox is much faster than trading on #bitcoin-otc.
While Mt. Gox is practically instant if you&#8217;re willing to buy for a price that someone is willing to sell for, #bitcoin-otc requires you to establish a dialog with someone, arrange payment, and worry about whether or not you are getting scammed.
Thus #bitcoin-otc takes at least several minutes, if not much longer depending on technical difficulties that may arise.
But on Mt. Gox, trades often take less than one second.
</p>

<p>Both methods of trading, #bitcoin-otc and Mt. Gox, are useful.
For #bitcoin-otc, I especially like that you can use the web of trust to build up a reputation; presumably, you could use this reputation for things other than simple trading if you ever wanted.
But the convenience of Mt. Gox for simple trading is hard to beat (once you get your money into it).

<li>Randall Munroe, the guy who writes <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, shows up in #bitcoin-otc from time-to-time.</li>
<li>MagicalTux, the guy who runs Mt. Gox, and gdoteof, the guy who created the <a href="http://www.iusecoins.com/">bitcoin t-shirt</a>, and various other famous bitcoiners show up in #bitcoin-otc from time-to-time.</li>
