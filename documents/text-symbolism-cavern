				<p>When I was young, I tripped and fell on my way to school. As the concrete opened up and I began to stumble down an endless cascade of dirt and large metallic spikes, I caught a glimpse of a sign labelled &#8220;This is your life. Heh.&#8221;</p>



<p>I regained control about fifty feet down when I landed on a short plateau. It was extremely muddy, and I found it difficult not to slip off. Above me I could see a speck of light where I had fallen through, and below me I could see demons setting up a portable trampolene for me to land on. Instead of going up or down, I decided to sit put, and eat my lunch.</p>



<p>A short time later I took my afternoon nap, and woke up in a classroom where my teacher was teaching cursive writing. I quickly dismissed it as rubbish, asked her for a bathroom break, and never went back to school.</p>



<p>I did some independent reading and learned how to trick gravity into letting me fly. I spent the rest of my life doing handstands and posting on internet forums. Now what?</p>
