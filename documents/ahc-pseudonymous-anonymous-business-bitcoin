According to Matthew Yglesias, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/08/18/299356/to-save-the-economy-you-sometimes-need-to-ignore-business/">the state should ignore business in order to &#8220;save the economy.&#8221;</a>
I think this is a terrible idea because the state only has one tool at its disposal that other organizations don&#8217;t have: force.
Yglesias is suggesting that the state force people to have certain behaviors in order to save the economy.
But this directly causes harm to the economy&#8212;where I am using the term &#8220;economy&#8221; broadly to mean the sum of human interaction with one another&#8212;because the very act of forcing people to do stuff is harm to the economy.
Force has further implications, mostly negative, because the effects ripple out to situations far removed from the actual use of force.
For instance, the fact that people are encouraged to go into debt, thus making their lives awful, is due to the fiat currency/central bank/fractional reserve bank financial system we have in the United States (and elsewhere).
This system is enforced by the state under threat of violence (for instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Dollar">anyone who tries to create a competing currency for the dollar is jailed</a>).
The only positive effects from force are to the people doing the forcing.
Their interests are served at the expense of the people being forced.

I think businessmen are right about the way to save the economy.
We need less force, and thus less government.
I do not believe the answer to this is to use government to fix itself&#8212;that is a contradiction.
The answer must come from the free market.
So I have a suggestion.
The problem at hand is that businesses are forced to do stuff because the owners are threatened with violence from the state.
But this threat is neutralized if the state does not know who the real-world owners of a business are.
Thus by constructing pseudonymous companies&#8212;which are companies that have a constant, sustained identity that can slowly develop a good reputation, but where that identity is never attached to the real-world identity of its owners&#8212;businesses can simply ignore bad laws.
Their only constraint will be that they need to maintain a good reputation in order to continue getting business.
Pseudonymous businesses are now possible, because they can be paid in and pay with bitcoins.

<p>
There are two examples of pseudonymous businesses that I am aware of: Silk Road and MyBitcoin.
MyBitcoin has failed, but Silk Road is still operating.
Silk Road ignores drug laws.
But drug laws are not the only laws that should be ignored.
Intellectual property (IP) laws, in particular <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/terrible-cost-patents/">patents</a> and copyrights, are further destructive laws that should be ignored.
It is now possible to ignore them thanks to bitcoin.
Innovative companies are now free to operate pseudonymously and simply ignore patent and copyright laws.
They cannot be destroyed by the state because the state will not know who the owners are.
</p>

<p>I would never encourage anyone do anything that is unethical, and some laws do encourage ethical behavior.
Unfortunately, many laws prevent people from doing perfectly ethical things, thus making the world on the whole worse off.
Bitcoin enables people to operate pseudonymous companies that simply ignore the law, because the state cannot employ force against the owners, because it doesn&#8217;t know who the owners are.
Save yourself from violence by operating your company pseudonymously where possible.
Your life and the lives of everyone on the whole will be better.
