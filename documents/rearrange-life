<p>I needed to rearrange my life, so I pushed my love for bicycling several years later until I was an adult. Yes, I think it&#8217;s better this way. I can really feel the love for bicycling now.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s weird&#8212;now I have memories of being passionately interested in ice skating as a kid. I didn&#8217;t see that one coming.</p>
