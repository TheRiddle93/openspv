					<p>I was at the shore with my son today when he saw a flying bird for the first time. He pointed at it and said, &#8220;I want to do that, daddy!&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t fly, son,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Our wings aren&#8217;t designed for that.&#8221;</p>

					<p>The tears welled up in his eyes and it just broke my heart. Sometimes it sucks to be a penguin.</p>
