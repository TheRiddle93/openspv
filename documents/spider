				<p>I saw a spider on the wall of the bathroom the other day while I was urinating. There was nothing I could do but watch him crawl along. I waited, and waited. He was getting closer to me. Finally my hands were free, so I grabbed a shoe, taped some tissue paper to it, and smashed him. I flushed the tissue paper and washed my hands. And then I left.</p>
