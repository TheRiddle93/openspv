								<p>I awoke with a hankering to take over the world. What I did instead was hang out with Paul McCartney while aliens tried to get our world back in order. The previous day I had finished coding a search engine so powerful that it could find things that didn&#8217;t even exist yet. Then, mysteriously, everybody in the world disappeared. I stole a car, drove around for a while, got tired, and eventually went to sleep, without ever figuring out why I was all alone. I had decided to save that problem for another day.</p>

	<p>Paul McCartney was looking at me through my bedroom window. &#8220;OMG!&#8221; he said. I struggled to find my glasses. &#8220;WTF,&#8221; I said, once I realized who it was. &#8220;LOL, my friends are never gonna believe this.&#8221;</p>



	<p>&#8220;STFU, there&#8217;s someone else here!&#8221; said McCartney, who couldn&#8217;t help but sing his urgency with a nice melody.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Paul McCartney!&#8221; I said. &#8220;You were a member of The Beatles! And now you&#8217;re staring at me through my bedroom window!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;There are aliens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve accidentally shifted all the human beings out of phase with the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>



	<p>&#8220;You mean&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not human.&#8221;</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it. We hung out for the rest of the day, ate some sandwiches, played frisbee on the quad, and waited for the aliens to fix things. I never got the see them, but I have no reason to believe they didn&#8217;t exist.</p>
