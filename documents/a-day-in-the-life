				<p>I got out of bed, put on my alligator slippers, and walked over to my computer to check the ticker&#8212;ten. That&#8217;s how many times I had lived this day over. People seem to think that just because I own a popular website that therefore I am some sort of super deity capable of manipulating the laws of physics, but nothing could be further from the truth. I am just as much a victim of Newton&#8217;s fourth law as every other convicted criminal punished by being forced to relive every day of his life until he finds the red key and the place to put it.</p>

				<p>I had already found the red key. I&#8217;d tell you where I found it, but it&#8217;s kind of embarrassing, so let&#8217;s just say that all I had to do was eat a little bit and wait a little while to find out. After I was done looking at the ticker (it was just a program that ran on my computer, but it had a really neat interface that made it kind of fun to watch), I decided I would eat some breakfast. I had followed this exact routine for ten days in a row, and before that I did pretty much the same thing as well. Look at the ticker, eat breakfast. Today I was going to eat a different kind of cereal.</p>

				<p>And there it was&#8212;inside the box of Lucky Charms, like some sort of perverse prize for children. Of course I was going to have to retrieve the red key again since things reset every day I don&#8217;t put the red key in the keyhole, so I ate a whole lot of the Lucky Charms. Then I went to watch some TV. After watching TV for a while, I decided to eat some lunch. When I was done with lunch, I started watching TV again, and then I took a nap. Immediately after the nap I ate some dinner, while the TV played in the background. And then I felt the urge to use the restroom.</p>

				<p>I grabbed the box of Lucky Charms first.</p>
