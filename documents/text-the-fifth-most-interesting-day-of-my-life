				<p>Today was the fifth most interesting day of my life. I woke up early with little sleep&#8212;I almost never do that&#8212;and headed to Polical Science class to take my third and final test. However, after passing the third stoplight on the way, I was hit head-on by small convertible that crossed a double yellow line. It bounced off, and my car was misdirected into a ditch. Needless to say, I had to walk the rest of the way.</p>

				<p>Arriving thirty minutes late for my test, I breezed through it and then started the long trek back home. Suddenly, darkness swept across the sky and I could no longer see. Wind picked me up off the ground and, apparently, flung me three miles to my home. At least that&#8217;s what I figure since the next thing I remember was lying in my front lawn staring at cloud formations that read &#8220;You failed.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I picked my muddy self up off the ground and stumbled into the house. My head hurt like no other, so I took some Tylenol PM and fell immediately into a deep sleep. I dreamt of cloud formations that read &#8220;Failed,&#8221; just to the left of which was a giant check mark.</p>

				<p>I awoke to find the TV blaring. Had I fallen asleep on the couch? The news lady spoke of a meat company that once prided itself on making Grade A meat that now gets Grade F. Had I eaten yet today? She then ripped off her clothes and jumped into our hot tub with four other naked women. Just as I was about to join them, my car landed in our backyard. I shouldn&#8217;t have left it in that ditch after the accident. &#8220;You're such a failure,&#8221; it said. It then exploded in a puff of Political Science.</p>

				<p>Wait &#8217;til you hear what the fourth most interesting day of my life was.</p>
