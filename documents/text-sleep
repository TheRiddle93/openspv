								<p>I suppose I get about sixteen hours of sleep per day on average. I usually go to bed around 9PM, and wake up at about 8:30AM, just enough time to take a shower and get to work a few minutes late. I take a few naps throughout the day, mostly while sitting at my desk, but also at lunch, and during bathroom breaks. I sleep in traffic sometimes, and I always take a nap when I get home. I wake up for dinner, and then I watch some TV, and then I go to bed again. You could call it a routine.</p>

	<p>Weekends are usually the worst because I have nothing to do. I can get about eighteen hours of sleep if I&#8217;m really tired, but the remaining six are usually some of the dullest times of the week. Sometimes I watch TV, but I don&#8217;t like any shows. Sometimes I browse through my books, but I&#8217;ve read them all. I don&#8217;t like to go out so I just have to stick with the books I have. So sometimes I will just sit on the couch and do nothing for a few hours, possibly thinking about something, or possibly thinking about nothing. I find it&#8217;s a rough mental exercise to try to think about nothing, so when it doesn&#8217;t come naturally, I am sometimes forced to think about things like work, or the lack of good TV shows, or the lack of good books, or maybe something else, like the strange dreams I have when I am asleep.</p>

	<p>The best dreams come after first nine or ten hours. I usually wake up every fifteen or so minutes at that point, probably because physiologically I have actually had enough sleep. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t need to tell you how realistic some dreams can be. Lately I&#8217;ve been having more of the same kinds of dreams, and there is one that has been reoccurring especially frequently. I like it a lot. It usually starts where I&#8217;m in the office, and I&#8217;m just looking out the window, into another office, and I just watch the people talk to each other. Sometimes the people talk to me, and sometimes I become the people, but mostly I&#8217;m just sitting at my desk watching them. They can be mesmerizing. I usually can&#8217;t even hear them, but I can see them move.</p>



	<p>Sometimes I wake up when I don&#8217;t want to, usually in the middle of a good dream. It&#8217;s horrible to suddenly become aware that a dream is not real. My worst nightmares usually involve waking up. Other times I wake up when I do want to, like when the traffic starts to move (or starts to stop), or when my boss walks into the room. Yesterday I wasn&#8217;t so lucky, so I was fired. My boss has actually caught me sleeping a lot, so I guess it was time.</p>

	<p>Of course the first thing I did when I got home was go to bed. It was in the middle of the day, which is usually quite a bit early to go to bed, even for me. And of course I had slept pretty much all morning long. So I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I tried to think about nothing, but that just kept me awake. So I laid in bed for about fourteen hours, mostly worrying about things that I don&#8217;t usually have to worry about. It was probably the worst experience of my life.</p>

	<p>Then about an hour ago I found myself waking up, in the middle of a cold, dreary day, after having been asleep for who knows how long. It made me happy. So I had to write about it. Unfortunately I guess no one will ever read it, except for me. Then again, I guess no one but me would actually want to read it. This is going to be the best weekend in a long time.
