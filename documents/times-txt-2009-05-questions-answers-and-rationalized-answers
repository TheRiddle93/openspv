<p><strong>Question.</strong> Why do you behave immorally sometimes?</p>
<p><strong>Answer.</strong> Some combination of instinct and learned behavior. Conscious thought has almost nothing to do with it. Usually, I rationalize a reason only after I have already performed the action.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalized Answer.</strong> It was a lapse in judgment. Why don&#8217;t you ask me about all those times I behaved morally? None of those were lapses in judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Where do you get your morality from?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> My environment. I was trained to behave this way.</p>
<p><strong>RA.</strong> I logically concluded that it is best to be moral. You know, it&#8217;s amazing how many people there are who don&#8217;t share my morality. I should probably spread the word or something.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do you have so much less than some people?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I was not as fortunate as them.</p>
<p><strong>RA.</strong> I haven&#8217;t worked hard enough. Now you&#8217;re making me wish I didn&#8217;t call in sick today.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do you have so much more than most people?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I was in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>RA.</strong> I am just way better than most people, apparently. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t such a bad idea to call in sick today after all. I can just make up for it tomorrow with my superhuman levels of productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why do you keep rationalizing your behavior?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>RA.</strong> Did I rationalize my behavior? It&#8217;s probably better that way.</p>
