<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to get this chimpanzee to absorb knowledge through language,&#8221; said the male human.
&#8220;So I&#8217;m reading him books and showing him movies. I want him to absorb these facts and believe them just as though he had discovered them himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t work,&#8221; said the female human. &#8220;Chimpanzees aren&#8217;t smart enough for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fuck you,&#8221; said the chimpanzee.</p>
