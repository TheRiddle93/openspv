				<p>I wrote &#8220;help needed&#8221; next to some difficult calculus problems. It didn&#8217;t do any good.</p>

	<p>Then I wrote, &#8220;Nevermind. I got it, bastards.&#8221; Before my pencil had left the paper, Kurt GÃ¶del appeared out of thin air, smacked me in the writing arm with an elongated &#8220;S,&#8221; and vanished. I still get chills when I think about formal systems to this day.</p>
