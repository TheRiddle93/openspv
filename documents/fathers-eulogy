<p>About a year ago I decided I needed a gun.</p>

<p>One reason was self-defense: I wanted to be able to defend my home should I ever need to.</p>

<p>Another reason was hunting: I wanted to be able to be able to eat animals that I personally hunted.</p>

<p>And finally, I wanted to be able to go trap shooting.</p>

<p>So I bought a shotgun.</p>

<p>When I learned that dad died, I have to admit, it occurred to me that I guess this means I gets to inherit his gun collection.</p>

<p>I am going to have such an arsenal now!</p>

<p>My home is going to be so well-defended.</p>

<p>And my hunting options are basically unlimited because I have every kind of gun now.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I also just got a new car. This is the fourth car I've had that used to be dad's.</p>

<p>But it will be the first car I've had that I actually have to take care of.</p>

<p>I hope he left instructions because I don't really know what to do.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if he did!</p>

<p>&#8220;In the event of my death, remember to change the oil every three months. And check the air pressure in the tires!&#8221;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>You know, there's one thing of his I'm never going to have.</p>

<p>I'm never going to have his mustache.</p>

<p>It comes in over here [side of face], but it doesn't come in up here [mustache]!</p>

<p>I don't know how that's possible. I thought I had his genes!</p>

<p>I guess my mustache genes come from my mom's side of the family.</p>

<p>Male pattern baldness, though?</p>

<p>That comes from both sides of the family.</p>

<p>But don't worry about it, it's all good. The intelligence? The good looks? That comes from both sides of the family too.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Dad was responsible. He took care of us. He devoted his life to his family.</p>

<p>The saddest moment for me was the day after he died, when we were making preparations for the funeral and taking care of financial issues.</p>

<p>I realized that we had to take care of this, because dad couldn't take care of it for us.</p>

<p>That was when I really understood that he was gone.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In dad's honor, I would like to propose that we all go to Red Lobster and eat fried shrimp.</p>

<p>But only one time! Don't keep going or you'll have a heart attack!</p>
