<a href="http://contrariancompliance.com/2013/04/14/is-us-regulation-the-single-biggest-threat-to-bitcoin/">Compliance with US regulations concerning money transmission for small bitcoin businesses is extremely challenging</a>.
It is so challenging that some businesses may find that compliance is prohibitive, while maintaining <a href="ahc/pseudonymous-anonymous-business-bitcoin/">pseudonymity</a> through cryptography, and simultaneously not complying, is not prohibitive because it is so much cheaper.
Thus, their only option if they want to operate is to operate pseudonymously.
