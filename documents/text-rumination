						<p>I walked into my room a moment ago and saw myself lying in bed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ryan?&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>I rolled over and looked at me, struggling to open my eyes. Why had I turned the lights on?</p>

	<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I said.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Go back to sleep.&#8221;</p>



	<p>I turned off the lights and left me alone. Time to get back to my English paper.
