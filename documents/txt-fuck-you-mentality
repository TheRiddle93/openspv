<p>

I&#8217;ve identified a trait that is common to a few organizations that are going through tough times.

I call it the &#8220;fuck you&#8221; mentality.

</p>

<p>1. The Bush administration: &#8220;Fuck you, I&#8217;m going to govern how I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. The financial industry: &#8220;Fuck you, I&#8217;m going to buy what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. The American automobile industry: &#8220;Fuck you, I&#8217;m going to make what I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>4. The oil industry: &#8220;Fuck you. Fuck you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>

Actually, the oil industry is doing fine.
