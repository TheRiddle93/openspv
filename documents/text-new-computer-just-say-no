						<p>Thinking of buying a new computer? Think again. Computer prices are always lowering on a daily basis. If you buy a new computer today, in five months, you could get the same computer for 30% less. That could be a difference of thousands of dollars, and that&#8217;s a fact.</p>

	<p>Think waiting five months is going to save you money? Think again. Wait another five months and the price of that same computer is going to be even lower. I&#8217;m not kidding, folks. This is scientific fact. It&#8217;s called Moore&#8217;s law. You can never win.</p>

	<p>What should you do, then? Don&#8217;t buy a new computer. Ever. A friend of mine recently told me she was going to buy an iPod. You know what I told her? I told her she was an idiot. And then I told her to stop being so stupid. Don&#8217;t ever buy anything even related to computers. Just Say No to technology. Don&#8217;t buy a car, they depreciate. Don&#8217;t buy an animal, they die. Don&#8217;t ever buy anything ever. Your savings account will thank you for it. You heard it here first.</p>
