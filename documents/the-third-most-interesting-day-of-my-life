				<p>I had just spent the last 48 hours coding a search engine so powerful it can find things that don&#8217;t even exist yet. The idea had come to me in a dream, and I woke up with the intent of finishing it before I went back to sleep. Two days later I was nearly complete, but the tiredness was overbearing, and I was out of Red Bull. I got in my car, pulled out of the drive way, and I don&#8217;t remember anything else. I was jolted into awareness by an angry homeless man banging on my windshield and shouting adjectives. &#8220;Large,&#8221; &#8220;evil,&#8221; &#8220;unholy,&#8221; etc. As he ran away, I noticed a 4-pack of Red Bull in my lap, and a large duffle bag packed with hundred dollar bills. I had absolutely no idea where it came from.</p>

				<p>The last thing I could remember was shifting into first. I must have fallen asleep at the wheel, sleep-drove to the store, bought the Red Bull, and robbed a bank. I looked out my window, and saw the bank rolling past. I quickly realized I was in gear, so I turned the wheel and decided to keep on going. I pulled out of the lot and looked for cops, hoping that I had been smart when I had robbed the bank. There weren&#8217;t any cops, and in fact, there weren&#8217;t any cars at all. I just kept on driving.</p>

			

				<p>My house was silent. It was 4pm, and none of my roommates were around. I popped open a Red Bull and looked out my back window. There was a giant hole where previously there had been grass. What the hell is going on? I suspiciously walked outside, expecting someone to jump and and yell that it was all a joke. The hole must have been about twenty feet in diameter, and there was dirt scattered all around, covering that side of my house, and the fences, and even my neighbors&#8217; houses. In the exact middle of the hole was something silver and shiny, so I jumped in and picked it up. It was a Hershey&#8217;s Kiss. Naturally, I ate it.</p>

				<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if one of my roommates had been playing in the dirt, so I decided to let someone else deal with the gaping hole in our backyard. I went back inside and checked on my search engine.</p>

				<p>An alert box on my screen said &#8220;Spidering complete&#8212;20 billion web pages total.&#8221; Had I finished my search engine? I thought back and tried to remember, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how far I had gotten. I clicked &#8220;OK&#8221; and looked at the search box where a query had already been typed out: &#8220;What the hell is going on?&#8221; it said. Yeah, exactly, I thought. I clicked the &#8220;search&#8221; button and immediately got three million results. The first one was the only one that seemed relevent. It was entitled &#8220;What happened? The Day the World Freaked Out.&#8221; And its summary read, &#8220;All your answers lie within.&#8221;</p>

			

				<p>I clicked it, and got the hourglass. Suddenly AIM signed off, and SoulSeek disconnected. I checked my modem, and oh my God&#8211;internet was down. Perfect timing.</p>

				<p>I was sweating. Where the hell are all my roommates? What the hell is going on? I paced around the room trying to sort through things, when I glanced through the window and noticed a shadowy figure peering into my car. Thank God I had brought the bag full of money inside. The shadowy figure then busted out my window and climbed in. I was so befuddled I couldn&#8217;t do anything but stand and watch. He somehow managed to start the car, and then drove off. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh&#8211;I drive a beat to hell &#8216;93 Ford Escort, and someone actually put forth effort to steal it.</p>

				<p>I walked to the closest Ferrari dealer. I then realized we didn&#8217;t have a Ferrari dealer in town, so I settled for BMW. I didn&#8217;t see another human being the whole way there. The streets were empty; the dealership was vacant. I stole an M5. I drove around at incredible speeds for hours, but I had been awake for a long time, and after a while I got too tired to continue. Having yet to see another living being, it was very quiet when I went to sleep around 10pm.</p>
