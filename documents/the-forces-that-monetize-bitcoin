<p>
The monetization of bitcoin (becoming generally accepted as a medium of exchange) is nearly guaranteed for the following reasons:
</p>

<p>
1) The unique advantage of bitcoin as delocalized gold or, equivalently, intangible currency with no trust requirement and a limited supply or, equivalently, a decentralized ledger with limited space.
Since such a thing did not previously exist but has some value on the market, bitcoin fills this niche.
This provides the initial value of bitcoin and a foundation upon which to grow.
</p>

<p>
2) The network effect, which encourages users to proselytize for bitcoin since they get more value from it if more people use it.
This ensures that bitcoin will grow beyond the foundation with an unlimited potential.
</p>

<p>
3) The first-mover advantage, or the fact that bitcoin was the first to offer its unique featureset.
This ensures that competitors are unlikely to dominate over bitcoin since bitcoin already has much more momentum.
</p>

<p>
4) The rational self-interest of bitcoiners (in the Austrian sense).
This ensures that any fixable problems will be fixed and any competitors cannot outpace bitcoin for long since bitcoin will quickly be made competitive in order to serve the interests of its users.
</p>

<p>
Combined, these forces mean bitcoin is likely to continue to grow in its use as medium of exchange until everyone on the planet is using it, with inexpensive and virtually free electronic devices, and cheap transaction costs determined by the market.
It will also change in form along the way as it conquers any competitors that pose fatal threats.
