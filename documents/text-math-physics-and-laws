				<p>After an hour investigating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a> and reading Wigner&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</a>, I had the urge to scratch something onto a piece of paper: &#8220;Only when laws appear to be followed do there appear to be laws.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then I realized that I had spent an hour reading about mathematics when I was supposed to be doing mathematics. Off I went&#8212;to the living room.</p>

	<p>Because that&#8217;s where the math is.</p>
