						<p>Welcome to <cite>This Post is in Beta</cite> version 1.0 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_stage">beta</a>)! Normally I don&#8217;t like to release posts until I&#8217;m sure they are stable, but this post couldn&#8217;t wait. I&#8217;ve decided to release it to the public before I&#8217;ve finished writing it. [Note to self: this sentence gives redundant information. Consider revising it in the next release.]</p>

	<p>Like <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/">all</a> <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">of</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/frghp?hl=en&#038;tab=wf&#038;q=">your</a> <a href="http://maps.google.com/">favorite</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/lochp?hl=en&#038;tab=fl&#038;ned=us&#038;q=">Google</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">apps</a>, <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">social networking sites</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx">software</a> <a href="http://desktop.yahoo.com/">utilities</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&#038;q=beta">more</a>, this post fills a niche in the market, and was in everyone&#8217;s best interest to be released ahead of schedule. And like many of the computer world&#8217;s other famous betas, it will likely be in beta forever.</p>



	<p>Features include:</p>

	<ol>

	<li>It&#8217;s here now.</li>

	<li>It&#8217;s good enough.</li>

	<li>And it&#8217;s in beta!</li>



	</ol>

	<p>Download the latest version (for free!) at <a href="text/this-post-is-in-beta">funnylogic.com</a>. Of course, if you are reading this, you have already downloaded it. I realize the auto-download feature is a tad intrusive (privacy activists got on my case during the pi-gamma phase of version -3.6 + 0.2i), so future releases are subject to change without notice.</p>

	<p>You should read <cite>This Post is in Beta</cite>, because&#8230; [insert catchy geek-phrases here to convince public of this post&#8217;s grandeur.]</p>
