<p>
I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m only just now finding out about Subterrainland. A huge fraction of the world&#8217;s population live in an immense network of caverns under South America, and it has taken me 25 years of life to even hear of this place. Did you know they invented the fluorescent light bulb?

It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve been living in a cave for all this time. Or, to a Subterrainlander, like I&#8217;ve been living in the open.
