					<p>I found myself in a house I didn&#8217;t recognize. The wood floors were dark and uninviting, the white walls were littered with paintings of bored white men that looked all too unhappy to have me there, and the stairs had gaping holes that fell into oblivion. It was so scary it was neat, so I sat down on a bean bag and waited.</p>
