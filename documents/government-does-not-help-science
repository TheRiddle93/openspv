<p>Technology, and presumably the theoretical understanding of technology and the experimental data behind it in the form of science, seems to proceed along a smooth exponential curve throughout history independent of governments.
Thus is does not seem that government really helps science much, even though it funds a lot of it.
I was going to make a long argument about this, but I was pleased to discover today that people have already made arguments for free market science, so I&#8217;ll just leave it to them for now.
