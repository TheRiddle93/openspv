<p>It is unethical to use force.
Government, which has a monopoly on force, is inevitably abused by individuals acting in their own interests, which will inevitably conflict with the interests of others.
And such a system can never be stable, because the people who lose will force the system to change.
This fact is all that is needed to understand the flaw in Robin Hanson&#8217;s position against libertarianism, which he explains in 
<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/08/why-im-not-libertarian.html">Why I&#8217;m Not Libertarian</a>.
</p>

<p>Hanson&#8217;s argument&#8212;that, apparently, there should exist entities that force us to do stuff&#8212;seems to rest on two principles: 1) Libertarianism is less efficient than a hypothetical planned society.
2) Libertarians have an irrational attachment to contracts because they were physically abused as children.
The second point is an ad hominem and has nothing to do with whether or not libertarianism is the correct position to hold.
The first point, that an efficient planned society is better, seems to forget that people&#8217;s interests do not always overlap, and thus the people planning the efficient society are obviously going to place their own interests above the interests of others.
Thus we must recognize that because it is unethical for the planners to force people who would lose to participate in their society, such a society can never be stable.
The only stable society is where everyone&#8217;s right to freedom from force is recognized equally and universally.
Such a system could never be designed by rational humans who have their own interests in mind.

<p>
The power of the state to force people to do stuff will be abused by the people who have the most power, unless those people are irrationally acting against their own best interests.
But irrational behavior can never be sustained, because rational behavior will always beat it.
So the power of the state to force people to do stuff will actually necessarily be abused in the long run.
How do we fix this?
The only resolution to this that I see is to scale the size of the state down to the individual.
All this requires is that we merely recognize that this is already the case.
We are our own sovereign states.
If you find that you are in a situation where you are being forced to do stuff to serve someone else&#8217;s interests, then use your power as a sovereign state to change your situation.
</p>

<p>In summary, government is unethical because it forces people to do stuff.
And it is always self-interested people behind the abuses of this power.
Hanson&#8217;s argument that libertarianism is not efficient ignores the fact that the people who design the &#8220;efficient&#8221; system will, as rational agents, place their own interests above others, and will thus find themselves constructing a system that will inevitably collapse as the people who lose in the system force it to change.
(However, an efficient and stable system may evolve naturally, without having been designed by self-interested individuals at any point.)
The solution to this is to recognize that we all are sovereign individuals, with our own interests, and we can, and we will (insofar as we are rational) act in our own best interests, and will not accept being forced to act in someone else&#8217;s interests for long.
Liberty is realizing this.
