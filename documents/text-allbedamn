				<p>I sat coding something in my dark computer room. I made a mistake. &#8220;Allbedamn,&#8221; I said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Allbedamn indeed,&#8221; said a mysterious voice. I jumped. I had thought I was alone.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; I asked. I waited for a response, but I never got one. Eventually I left to watch some TV.</p>
