<p>My friend asked me what a said editor was, and I said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; As soon as I found out, I used one to change &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; to &#8220;I know exactly what that is, so I have no reason to be embarrassed.&#8221; Now that I have purchased my own, I have used it to edit all my previous conversations to make me sound really cool. I also tried to edit what my friends said to make them sound stupid, but I didn&#8217;t know what the root password was.</p>

<p>If you buy one, you should get the Apple one. People have said the greatest things about that one.</p>
