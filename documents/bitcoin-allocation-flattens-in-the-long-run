One of the common criticisms of bitcoin
(see comments in, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.links.org/?p=1164">1</a>,

<a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-the-cryptocurrency-Bitcoin-a-good-idea">5</a>) is that the initial allocation of bitcoins is unfair.
That&#8217;s true&#8212;the early adopters get many more bitcoins than everybody else.
It&#8217;s not fair at all.
However, because there are only a finite number of bitcoins, the distribution will probably flatten with time, so long as the bitcoin rich actually spend their bitcoins.
The reason is very simple: If you have a million bitcoins in a giant bitcoin economy, and you spend your bitcoins, it will be extremely difficult to get them back.
Thus, the richest bitcoiners will actually have fewer and fewer bitcoins with time, even if they continue to get richer due to the increasing value of their bitcoins.
