				<p>You know that feeling you get when you suddenly remember you have clothes in the wash so you go to put them in the dryer, but then realize there are towels in the dryer, so you take the towels out and put them on the floor before putting your clothes in the dryer, and then you go upstairs and take a shower only to get out and realize you don&#8217;t have a towel to use, so you have to choose between using a dirty shirt to dry off and running downstairs wet and naked to get a towel at the risk of being spotted by a roommate?</p>

				<p>I wonder what that&#8217;s like.</p>
