				<p>Professor Gubenstein,</p>

				<p>You are the nucleus whose time-independent potential determines my wavefunction. How appropriate it was that our first conversation was about the Schrodinger equation, for my de Broglie wavelength is determined entirely by the frequency by which I see you. Even in a pair of entangled photons does one see our relationship, for my happiness can be determined exactly by measuring your quantum state, even when we are on opposite sides of the globe (Speaking of which, my colleague has recently done some fascinating work on quantum entanglement. I will send you the arXiv link when it&#8217;s up.) In fact, a plot of my happiness versus time I spend with you is not only positive, but constant, which is the definition of love. Furthermore, since my probability distribution is a decaying exponential as a function of my radius with you (as is the case for the electron of any hydrogen like atom), one can conclude that that not only am I in love with you, but in fact I am deeply in love with you.</p>

				<p>Your husband,<br/>

				Professor Gubenstein</p>

				<p>P.S. I dig those pics of the LINAC!</p>
