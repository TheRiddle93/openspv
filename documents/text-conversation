				<p>So I was having a conversation with myself today when I blurted out, &#8220;Dude, I am a nutcase.&#8221; I then proceeded to explain to myself exactly why I was a nutcase, but completely neglected to mention the whole talking to myself instead of talking to other people thing. Nevertheless, I was totally offended and didn&#8217;t speak to myself for like an hour.</p>
