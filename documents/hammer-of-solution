						<p>When I find that running from my problems doesn&#8217;t solve them, I turn to my hammer. I beat everything in sight with that hammer, and it usually scares my problems so bad they run away. If they don&#8217;t, I label them insolvable and lock them in ignorance.</p>

	<p>I found a bag of answers yesterday, though I haven&#8217;t yet figured out how to open it. I&#8217;m sure once I do the answers will pop out at me.</p>

	<p>Ironically, next to the bag of answers was a box of probs. It was labelled just like that: &#8220;A Box of Probs.&#8221; I put the bag of answers in the box of probs and started beating things with my hammer. &#8220;Damn, I really love that hammer,&#8221; I said. The hammer nodded and returned to his business. Then I ran away with my arms flailing just for fun; I&#8217;m sure any bystanders caught my drift. Yeah, it was a box of probs, not of problems, but they knew what I meant. I know because several of the invisible ones were laughing internally. I could see right through them.</p>
