<p>Many organizations around the world, particularly governments and banks but also ordinary people, have too much debt.
This has created a global debt crisis that is quickly spiraling out of control.
It appears that Europe is in the most immediate danger since Greece is almost out of money, and this will ripple out to the rest of Europe.
But it&#8217;s not just Europe.
The United States government has probably already reached the point where either default or massive inflation must inevitably result, and it&#8217;s just a question of when.
Japan also has debt problems, and China has a giant real estate bubble.
And because all these great economies are so linked to each other and to the rest of the world, these problems are threatening the entire world financial system.
The age of fiat currencies, central banks, and fractional reserve banks may be coming to an end.
</p>

<p>Since I <a href="/ahc/world-financial-system-collapse/">last mentioned this issue</a>, I&#8217;ve been following it closely.
Here are some references I&#8217;ve found to help understand what&#8217;s going on.
</p>

<h2>Doug Casey and Casey Research</h2>

<p>The things Doug Casey have been saying about the economy are downright frightening.
One point he keeps making again and again is that governments are not just responding to the crisis by doing the wrong things, they are doing exactly the opposite of the right things.
By that he means they are increasing spending, snatching even more wealth from the most productive members of society, and redistributing it to the biggest losers.
This is not only not fixing the problem, but accelerating the collapse.

<h2>Zero Hedge</h2>

<p>Zero Hedge is a financial blog written by Tyler Durden&#8212;a pseudonym that probably represents more than one person since his/her/their output is so prolific&#8212;which is extremely well informed and lacking in the censorship of mainstream media.
(I believe mainstream media is too afraid of accidentally causing a financial crisis by merely giving out bad news&#8212;which actually could happen since fractional reserve banks are so inherently fragile&#8212;to be trusted to actually say the truth.)

</ul>

<p>I remain unconvinced that the entire world financial system is going to collapse in the near term for the simple reason that this is in basically no one&#8217;s best interest, and the powers that be (primarily, central banks and governments) are going to do everything in their power to prevent this from happening.
However, Doug Casey makes a good point that they are so confused about reality that they are likely to make things worse, accelerating the collapse.
So I consider a near term collapse to be a significant possibility, but not a certainty.
</p>

<p>Long term, however, a collapse is more likely, because of the inherently fragile nature of fractional reserve banking, central banks, and fiat currencies, and due to the unfairness of the system, which is unstable in light of the growing democracy of information enabled by the internet.
The people won&#8217;t stand for injustice as they gradually come to understand the nature of the system that is enabling the elites to win at their expense.</p>
