				<p>I was studying for my psychology test when I came along this definition: &#8220;Hindsight Bias: The tendency to overestimate one&#8217;s ability to have predicted an event once the outcome is known; the &#8216;I knew it all along&#8217; phenomenon.&#8221;</p>

				<p>And I found myself thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known about this for years.&#8221;</p>
