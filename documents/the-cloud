						<p>Two years ago I saw a cloud that looked just like first grade. I knew it was first grade because it said &#8220;1,&#8221; and not &#8220;2,&#8221; or anything else. I saw that same cloud today. I pooped in my pants and cried all the way home.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know why those things hang around, but sometimes it really makes me think. &#8220;Why am I here? Who am I?&#8221; etc. It pisses me off, too, because I already know who I am, and I sure as hell know why I&#8217;m here. As soon as I told all this to the cloud, he sort of frowned, and then started to rain. Then I started to cry, too, and I realized why clouds can be both a symbol for happiness and sadness, though I have since forgotten. Maybe it&#8217;s because they tend to look like grade school, which is a giant bag of mixed emotions. Speaking of which, I have a great story that I&#8217;ll tell you later.
