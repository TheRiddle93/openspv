<p>Creating new currency doesn&#8217;t create new wealth.
If I counterfeit a billion dollars and go buy stuff up, it might seem like I am &#8220;stimulating&#8221; the economy by introducing new wealth to it, but what really happens is that after I buy everything up, there is less of everything, but the demand is still the same, and so the prices for everything goes up, but everyone else has the same amount of currency, so they can buy less stuff.
They have lost purchasing power.
By counterfeiting a billion dollars, I have not created new wealth.
Rather, I have stolen approximately a billion dollars worth of wealth from everyone who uses the currency.

<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/08/16/296903/the-denial-of-currency/">Matthew Yglesias argues that printing currency can replace lost wealth</a>, but this is not so.
If you break a window and then counterfeit currency to pay for it, what is really happening is that the replacement of that window is being paid for by everyone else&#8212;the people who do not get the new currency and thus have lost their purchasing power&#8212;rather than you.
The destruction of the window has not been magically fixed by printing new currency.
Rather, the loss has been socialized.

<p>
If printing currency replaces wealth, then Ben Bernanke could destroy the entire planet, and then counterfeit new dollars to pay for it, and all would be well.
But this is not true.
And because this is not true, it proves by contradiction that the premise that printing currency replaces wealth must also be false.
</p>

<p>
Printing currency does not create wealth.
It moves it from the people who use the currency to the people who get the new currency.
This is fundamentally why fractional reserve banks, central banks, and fiat currencies are scams.
Printing currency does not solve problems.
It makes them.
