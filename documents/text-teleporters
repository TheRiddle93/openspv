				<p>Sometimes I worry that as soon as we invent teleporters we&#8217;ll have a huge robbery problem because people will just teleport into Wal-Mart, pick something up, and then teleport out. But then I remember that once we invent teleporters, people won&#8217;t want to steal stuff, because they&#8217;ll have a teleporter, and they could just teleport around all day instead of stealing stuff. That&#8217;s what I would do.</p>

				<p>Of course I would have to steal a teleporter first.</p>
