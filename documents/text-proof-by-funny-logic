				<p>A few years ago I constructed my own world that I live in. For the most part I have been able to ignore the real world since then, but a lot of people seem to be jealous and want to destroy my world. Some of them have done little more than scratch the paint on my ego shield, but a few of them have successully countered my assistant hand wavers. If I had to build it over, I would not use proof by example. I would use proof by funny logic, because that has been known to work once.</p>

				<p>Maybe I need more booby traps.</p>
