				<p>I was minding my own business when everyone suddenly said, &#8220;where did he come from?&#8221; My surroundings had changed. Somehow I was in some sort of office space, and the people around me didn&#8217;t look like people at all, they looked like&#8212; and suddenly I was back where I was, minding my own business, browsing <a href="http://blo.gs/">blo.gs</a>.
