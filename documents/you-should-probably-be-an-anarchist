<p>The biggest misconception about anarchy (no government) is that it is chaos.
But anarchy can have police and courts just like a state, except they operate as businesses rather than a government monopoly.
And, with police and courts, anarchy would be as peaceful as a state, except even more so because you would not be forced to pay for anything you don&#8217;t want, like wars and welfare.
But if anarchy would be just like what we have today except with no institutionalized coercion and therefore even more peaceful, why aren&#8217;t most people anarchists?
I believe, like my younger self, most of them are not anarchists (the ones who are not sociopaths) because they have not followed the implications of their own morality.
Most people are anti-violence and anti-theft.
But the government is intrinsically violent (it has a monopoly on force which it uses only sometimes for moral reasons but mostly to retain its own power, manipulate people, and skim something off the top of economic activity) and funded by theft (taxes, which people are forced to pay, are indistinguishable from theft, and therefore are theft).
If people merely follow the implications of their own morality, they will see that anarchy is the only moral choice.
