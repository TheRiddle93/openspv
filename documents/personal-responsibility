<p>I didn&#8217;t want to take responsibility for myself anymore, so I assigned responsibility to my neighbor.
I didn&#8217;t have to fill out any paperwork or even tell her, because she&#8217;s responsible for that now.
I&#8217;m a bit annoyed that she hasn&#8217;t given me a status update or even communicated with me in any way, but I trust that she knows what she&#8217;s doing.</p>
