<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t laugh, I&#8217;m going to have to arrest you,&#8221; said the officer, smiling.</p>

<p>The little boy began to cry, for he had been paralyzed from the mouth down since his accident the day before.

He struggled to form a smile, but it wasn&#8217;t possible.

At his bedside, his mother continued giggling.

She didn&#8217;t have a choice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have to do this,&#8221; said the officer.

&#8220;You have until the count of ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody tell a joke,&#8221; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t help,&#8221; said the doctor.</p>

<p>The officer counted down.

When he reached 1, he continued to 0, because the law technically allowed him to do so.

The extra time didn&#8217;t help the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wheel him out of here,&#8221; said the officer.

The team of laughter police detached the boy&#8217;s bed from the wall and wheeled him into the hallway.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is such bullshit,&#8221; said the doctor.

&#8220;Fuck the government and their bullshit bureaucratic laws.

He would laugh if he could, but it&#8217;s not even fucking possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said the officer.

&#8220;See that camera over there?

You are all on Police TV! The law states that everybody must laugh at all times, <em>except those who are not physically able.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;We would never arrest a helpless paralyzed child,&#8221; said the officer.

&#8220;But I am going to have to arrest the mother.

She was crying when I first arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, except the boy.</p>
