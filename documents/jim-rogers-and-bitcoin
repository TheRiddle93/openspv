Jim Rogers is a well-known investor who originally made his fortune in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Group_of_Funds">Quantum Fund</a>, but in more recent time has done well investing in commodities.
I have been reading his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Commodities-Anyone-Profitably-ebook/dp/B000FC2OO8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1374699479&sr=8-1&keywords=hot+commodities">&#8220;Hot Commodities,&#8221;</a> published in 2004, and find his arguments for commodities pretty solid (and informative), at least for 2004.

However, he vastly underestimated the bull market for gold, which he said was unlikely to surpass its all-time high of $850 unless there was some type of financial apocalypse.
Well, we are now living in a slow motion financial apocalypse, and gold has reached over $1300 (which is actually down from its new all-time high of about $1900, reached in 2011).
Naturally, I was curious about two things 1) What does Jim Rogers think about gold today? And, 2) What does Jim Rogers think about bitcoin?
</p>

<p>Jim Rogers went from gold skeptic in 2004 to pretty much a gold bull today.
He has given many interviews in the past year (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0sWPX49lgA">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DXUYUjtzSk">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DrqcQPyiHs">3</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydd80GheqyA">4</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT_tGXtUxK8">5</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB41ZjKQ0Tw">6, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_VLI5i4LsU">7</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTjykSUuOqI">8</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqp0AJe38Ec">9</a>) which reveal his position, which is that the vast, unprecedented and historic money printing by the central banks of the world has created a an unparalleled crisis that will likely send the price of gold higher as people flee to it to protect themselves.
That&#8217;s quite a change in stance from 2004, where he hesitantly recommended only owning a tiny amount of gold as a form of insurance against exactly the kind of ongoing catastrophe in which we are presently living.
He now encourages people to buy gold at today&#8217;s &#8220;low&#8221; prices (which are far higher than the former $850 all-time high that in 2004 he said gold was unlikely to surpass).

And what does Jim Rogers think about bitcoin, which is <a href="http://localhost:3000/archive/bitcoin-is-the-future-of-money-not-gold/">better than gold</a>, <a href="http://localhost:3000/archive/the-forces-that-monetize-bitcoin/">nearly guaranteed to be monetized</a>, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/archive/bitcoin-will-catalyze-hyperinflation-of-the-dollar/">likely to catalyze hyperinflation of the dollar</a>?
He has not yet taken the time to investigate bitcoin, which he reveals in <a href="http://www.jimrogersinvestments.com/2013/05/jim-rogers-nobody-gets-out-of-this.html?m=1">this interview</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNLTqp-s1XU">this video</a>.
That&#8217;s unfortunate, but then again, at least he has heard of it and honestly admits that he hasn&#8217;t researched it.
Just one year ago I would have been surprised if he had even heard of it, since bitcoin was so much further from the mainstream back then.
</p>

<p>Jim Rogers is a respectable investor.
Let&#8217;s see what he thinks when he does finally get around to investigating bitcoin in detail.</p>
