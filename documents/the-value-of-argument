<p>When I think about things on my own, I often find myself arriving at conclusions that are outside the mainstream.
And whenever this happens, explaining my thoughts to people seems fruitless, because 1) people are not very rational and do not respond well to rational arguments, and 2) even if they did respond to rational arguments, my arguments often have to be very long to unwind their misinformation and thus I do not have enough time to make my arguments.
However, I&#8217;ve found that there is tremendous value in making arguments anyway, even though I seem to never convince anyone of anything.
It helps me derive implications I may not have otherwise have thought of, correct mistakes I may not have otherwise realized I was making, and sometimes other people give me valuable feedback even if I didn&#8217;t change their mind about anything.
