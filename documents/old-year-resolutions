		<p>Instead of making new year resolutions, I&#8217;ve made a list of old year resolutions so that I can be sure I&#8217;ve already accomplished them.</p>

	<p>1. Shave sometimes.<br><br />

2. Quit and then go back to school.<br><br />

3. Change personal worldview several times and switch majors an equal number of times to reflect this.<br><br />



4. Be mysterious.<br><br />

5. Complete at least one list.<br><br />

6. Post one too many items to a list.</p>
