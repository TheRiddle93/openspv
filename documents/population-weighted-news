<p>It would be nice to have a news service that provided news from every country where the amount of news from each country was weighted by the population of that country. About 1/5 articles would be from China, about 1/6 would be from India, and all the other countries would have fewer articles. This would allow readers to get a less biased view of the world than just reading news from their home country. </p>
