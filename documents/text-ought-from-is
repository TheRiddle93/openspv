<p>
&#8220;We should fix this problem, so that things will be better,&#8221; she said.
</p>

<p>
&#8220;How do you know that&#8217;s what we should do?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Perhaps we should create more problems.
After all, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/05/03/you-cant-derive-ought-from-is/">you can&#8217;t derive ought from is</a>.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8220;But if we created more problems, things would be worse,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what if things are worse? Maybe that&#8217;s how things should be,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But things should be better, not worse,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see we have reached an impasse,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You think things should be better, and I think things should be worse.
There is no way to solve this disagreement.
This is a huge problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>She soon found somebody else to work with. That solved her problem, and gave him a new one.</p>
