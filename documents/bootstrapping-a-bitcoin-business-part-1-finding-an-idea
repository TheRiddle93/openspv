<p><a href="http://www.weusecoins.com/">Bitcoin</a> is a decentralized digital currency.
To put it simply (and only approximately), bitcoin is to the internet what gold is to land.
The growth of the bitcoin community has been explosive, and right now bitcoins are trading at approximately 8 USD for 1 BTC.
This is up from essentially no value at all a year ago.
</p>

<p>There are many reasons to start a bitcoin business:</p>

<ol>
<li>The bitcoin community will probably continue growing for some time, so there will be new people to purchase your products or services.</li>
<li>The value of bitcoins may continue to increase, so if your business has a lot of its value in bitcoin currency, it may become extremely valuable (or it may crash).</li>
<li>Some kind of digital currency is likely have a huge economy in the future. It is worth gaining experience with this kind of currency. And so long as there is no hidden flaw in the bitcoin design, bitcoin is likely to be that currency.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am extremely fascinated with bitcoin and think it is likely to succeed.
Unfortunately I have only been able to acquire 0.02 bitcoins so far (via the <a href="http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/">Bitcoin Faucet</a>), and in fact I am so new that I have not yet even been able to transfer money into the bitcoin exchange <a href="https://mtgox.com/">Mt. Gox</a>.
Furthermore, as an underpaid graduate student, I do not have abundant cash to invest in bitcoin once I am able to trade anyway.
But I won&#8217;t let this prevent me from bootstrapping a bitcoin business.
</p>

<p>
There are basically two classes of bitcoin businesses: businesses like <a href="https://clearcoin.appspot.com/">ClearCoin</a>, which deal entirely in bitcoins and thus live entirely in the bitcoin economy, and businesses like <a href="http://www.bitmunchies.com/">BitMunchies</a>, which sell a product or service and thus deal in the interaction of the bitcoin economy with the non-bitcoin economy.
There are also mining operations, but these mostly fall under the second category, since they use so many non-bitcoin resources to produce bitcoins.
With respect to the bitcoin-only category, I am not aware of any pressing need for new bitcoin-only businesses.
Thus, the option I will pursue is to create a company that sells a product or a service from the non-bitcoin economy for bitcoins.
Fortunately, since bitcoin is so new, there is probably something I can do that hasn&#8217;t already been done.
</p>

<p>My idea is for a t-shirt.
Actually, there already is a t-shirt, <a href="http://www.iusecoins.com/">and it&#8217;s not bad</a>.
I will surely be buying one once I have enough bitcoins.
But bitcoin is a big enough community (and it almost certainly will be bigger), that I think it could support another t-shirt, so long as this other t-shirt was sufficiently good and sufficiently different from the existing one.
It should be good enough that people who have already bought the first bitcoin t-shirt would be willing to buy the second&#8212;that way I&#8217;m not just competing with the existing t-shirt.
</p>

<p>Here is a sketch of it (<em>just a sketch</em>&#8212;obviously not final):</p>

<img style="width: 100%;" src="./images/2011-05-16-bitcoin-sketch.jpg" alt="Elements of the Future">

<p>It will be called &#8220;Elements of the Future.&#8221;
In case it isn&#8217;t obvious, the idea (inspired by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=genetics+robotics+nanotechnology">GNR</a>) is that the future will be made up of robots, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology (I forgot this one in the sketch, but it will probably be represented by a small robot), genetics technology, spaceships, and <em>bitcoins</em>.
In other words, bitcoins are going to be a big deal.
I think this message will appeal to the bitcoin community.
An important question is whether I will be able to pull off illustrating it since I am bit out of practice when it comes to graphic design.
(Obviously no one would buy it if it looked exactly like the sketch.)</p>

<p>The next steps in this series are going to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Produce the design and get feedback from the bitcoin community.</li>
<li>Assuming it gets good reviews, I will then make a run of t-shirts and begin selling them.</li>
<li>Profit?</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the t-shirt idea doesn&#8217;t work out, but I still believe in bitcoin, I will continue to try to bootstrap the business even after the first failure.
And while that experiment is going on, I will be performing a parallel experiment: Writing quality content for the bitcoin community (and everyone else).
All of the content on this website is free, and is even available under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">this Creative Commons license</a>.
If you appreciate this content, you are invited to donate to my bitcoin address, which is given at the bottom of the site.
I predict more profit will come from the t-shirts than from donations, for two reasons: 1) The t-shirts are probably worth more to most people. 2) You can read the content without donating, but you can&#8217;t wear the t-shirt without buying.
However, we will see.
