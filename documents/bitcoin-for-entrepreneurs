In order to earn as much money as possible, it is better to invent entire new industries that disrupt and displace prior, obsolete industries than it is to develop products and services within an existing industry.
Bitcoin is such a new industry, and it is the greatest industry disruption event in history since it disrupts money, half of every transaction.
Everyone will be richer after bitcoin replaces the dollar, but early adopters have the most to gain.
Some people will be made richer than anyone in history.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin is a protocol, and, like the internet, email, and other dominant protocols, it will be the protocol that wins over its competitors <a href="/documents/the-forces-that-monetize-bitcoin">due to</a>, 1) the first-mover advantage, 2) the network effect, and 3) the self-interest of participants to fix any problems and make any worthwhile additions (like how the internet has evolved to include the larger address space of IPv6 or email has evolved to include file attachments).
</p>

<p>
The way the internet is the solution to the problem of information transmission, bitcoin is the solution to the problem of money.
Bitcoin allows value to be stored (permanently and privately), divided, and transmitted (instantly and privately) between any two people anywhere in the world (where the security of the transaction is proportional to the length of time passed after the transaction).
Fiat currencies, gold, and fish are the precursors to bitcoin the way the telegraph is the precursor to the internet.
</p>

<p>
Fiat currencies are the most widely used form of money at present.
The way the internet disrupted the telegraph and democratized information transmission and made it harder for governments to censor people&#8217;s communications, bitcoin is disrupting fiat currencies and democratizing money and making it harder for governments to control people&#8217;s finances.
This will be better for everyone, but it won&#8217;t happen without a fight, since most governments will fight to retain control of the money supply.
</p>

<p>There are only 21 million bitcoins, but there are seven billion people.
Once bitcoin is adopted by the entire world, bitcoins will be worth millions of dollars each.
Right now they are selling for only about a hundred dollars each.
Therefore the easiest way to profit from bitcoin is to buy as many bitcoins as possible and wait.
However, you can earn more bitcoins by being an entrepreneur and putting time and effort into solving problems in the bitcoin economy.
Bitcoin entrepreneurship is necessary to maximize the wealth you acquire from the bitcoin revolution.
</p>

<p>
Don&#8217;t waste any more time on the legacy financial system that is about to be obsoleted.
Adopt bitcoin thoroughly and quickly, and, if you are not already working on industry-disrupting technology on the scale of bitcoin, solve the largest problems in the bitcoin economy thoroughly and quickly in order to maximize your profit of the bitcoin revolution.
The sooner you do this, the richer you will be in the future.
