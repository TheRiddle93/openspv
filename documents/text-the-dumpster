				<p>I woke up in a dumpster. It took me a while to figure out that&#8217;s what it was since it wasn&#8217;t filled with trash, it was filled with Glade Plugins&trade; and blankets. I looked out and noticed I was in some kind of forest where ancient trees lined each side of the dumpster. It formed a kind of natural alley. I looked down and noticed I was wearing an orange prisoner&#8217;s uniform, but since I knew I hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong, I cuddled up in the blankets and went back to sleep.</p>
