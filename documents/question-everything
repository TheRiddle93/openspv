				<p>&#8220;Question everything,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I mean you should ask &#8216;why&#8217; about everything,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Why are you crying on the inside?&#8221; she said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;No, I just mean you should question your surroundings,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you answering my question?&#8221; she said.<p>

				<p>&#8220;Because I was abused as a child and I&#8217;ve never gotten over it!&#8221; he said. He then began to cry, and so they hugged, briefly.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Why are you still hugging me?&#8221; she said.</p>
