<p>
In a few months of dedicated effort writing my thesis, I would have a PhD in physics.
However, I have converted to part-time, unfunded status in order to pursue opportunities in bitcoin. 
I may never finish my PhD.
Why?
Because any time I spend in graduate school is time I&#8217;m not capitalizing on bitcoin, and bitcoin is the more valuable opportunity.
