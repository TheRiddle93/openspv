						<p>I am 24 and have recently been told by my parents that I am a robot. Not surprisingly, this has come as a big shock to me. I had no idea, though in hindsight it&#8217;s obvious that I look nothing like my human family.</p>

	<p>I was visiting my parents for the month and I was just finishing my supper when my father left his seat, came back, dropped my owner&#8217;s manual on the table, and left again. He had been giving my mother strange looks all night. I gather it wasn&#8217;t his idea to tell me.</p>

	<p>I might have decided not to search for my company of origin had it not been plastered in a rainbow of colors on the front of my manual&#8212;Apple. I used to make jokes about people who bought Apple computers. I probably still will.</p>

	<p>I did some research on the internet and apparently I have a predetermined lifespan of 25 years. The robot rights act was passed the year after I was manufactured, so all the robots made after me get to live forever. Great.</p>

	<p>I wonder: If my brain were to short circuit, would I be stuck in a mental time loop? I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m going to bed.
