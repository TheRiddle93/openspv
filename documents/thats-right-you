						<p>People are often skeptical when I say I can see invisible people. &#8220;I can see you, can&#8217;t I?&#8221; I say, and then I wink at them. Then they give me one of these:</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t actually have a picture to show you exactly what they give me, but as it was implied, I feel this explanation is enough. You can imagine what I say to that. If you wouldn&#8217;t mind imagining the whole rest of the story, that would be great. You have a vivid imagination. It&#8217;s a happy ending, if you were wondering. Go ahead.
