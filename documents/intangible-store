						<p>I went to the Intangible&trade; store to buy some Evil&trade; when I noticed that Bargain&trade; was on sale. Unfortunately, I had done some Ignorance&trade; a few hours earlier, so I brushed the sale aside and proceeded to the checkout. Only now that I&#8217;ve had my Nighttime Regret&trade; with milk do I feel cheated. I ought to swallow my Pride&trade; and forget about it, but I have such little of that left, I might just dig into my Evil&trade;, with a side of Apathy&trade;, like always. I feel like such a loser.</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t do Evil&trade;, kids. It&#8217;s worse than Addiction&trade;.</p>
