				<p>I was having a pleasant silence with my neighbor when he blurted out: &#8220;I would like to stop asking people what I am saying, and find other ways to get my point across. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, trying to sound as convincing as possible. He sort of smiled, and I could tell that he was genuinely pleased with my response. I didn&#8217;t actually have a clue what it was that he was trying to say, but in my years as a person I&#8217;ve learned that people prefer the response &#8220;yes&#8221; to the response &#8220;no,&#8221; although by no means is this always true.</p>

				<p>No one said anything after that.</p>
