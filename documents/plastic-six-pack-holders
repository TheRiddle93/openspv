				<p>I sat on the shore of the lake, fishing with plastic six-pack holders. I had been trying this for hours to no avail. Having caught just weeds and mud, I threw in my line one more time and decided that this would be my last attempt. But as I dragged the empty six-pack holder back to shore, someone approached me from behind.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Nice day, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked the stranger. &#8220;What are you tryin&#8217; to do, fish?&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said, trying not to laugh out loud. That was so obvious!</p>

				<p>&#8220;Want to know what the meaning of life is?&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; I said, still laughing internally about his earlier remark.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Let me see if I can help you.&#8221; He spread his arms apart, and commanded the waters to part. And they did. On the bottom of the lake lay many dead fish, but most importantly, a door. &#8220;Follow me,&#8221; he said. And I did. When we reached the door, he knelt down and unlocked it. &#8220;Open it,&#8221; he said. I swung the door open, revealing a staircase into paradise. &#8220;All I can do is take you here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must enter alone. I can go no farther.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I felt bad, but this was paradise. I had to leave him. But upon entering what I thought was paradise, I was transported through a wormhole back to my house. At least I thought it was my house. I tried to read the newspaper, but it was printed backwards. I tried to watch TV, but people were talking in reverse. I looked in the mirror, and I was upside down. Clearly, I was in someone else&#8217;s home. I left immediately. Arriving at my real house several hours later, I noticed I had a fish in my pocket. A fish with a plastic six-pack holder around its neck.</p>
