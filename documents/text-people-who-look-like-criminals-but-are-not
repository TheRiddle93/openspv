<p>A lot of services (Google, Facebook, Banks) prevent access to people who look like criminals (people who post the wrong things, or who participate in the wrong type of financial transactions).
Some of these people are criminals, but some of these people are not.
While I fully support punishing criminals by ostracizing them from our systems, it is a bad idea to also deny access to people who are not criminals.
Systems that allow these people to operate will defeat systems that do not allow these people to operate, due to the network effect (the non-criminals who look like criminals can convince anyone to use these open systems, but you can&#8217;t convince anyone who looks like a criminal to use a system that won&#8217;t let them use it).
Bitcoin is the first open financial system that lets value be transported between any two places.
The fact that it is open is why it will replace fiat currencies
(and the fact that it is location-independent is why it will replace gold).
