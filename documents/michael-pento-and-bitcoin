<p>Since bitcoin is new and different than anything that came before, it takes a bit of time to understand what it is.
For that reason it&#8217;s always interesting to hear what people think about it after they have, or haven&#8217;t, taken the time.
Michael Pento, author of the book &#8220;The Coming Bond Market Collapse,&#8221; which I just finished reading, was, as of April 1st, clearly someone who had not taken the time to understand bitcoin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1POVoi9NPk">as we can see in this video</a>.
The fears he displays are, 1) bitcoin is not scarce, 2) bitcoin is destructible.
Both of this fears are unwarranted since bitcoin is both scarce and indestructable.
Additionally, Pento claims gold is superior to bitcoin, but he does not appreciate the localized nature of gold and delocalized nature of bitcoin.
</p>

<p>The central technological advance of bitcoin is that it is a protocol for storing and transmitting value instantly between any two locations that does not depend on a trusted central authority.
Such a protocol could have had any number of monetary units, or any supply function.
However, the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, made a wise economic choice in limiting the number of bitcoins to 21 million, which provides people an incentive to adopt and hold bitcoin.
This fact is ensured by crytography and computational power.
Because will never be more than 21 million bitcoins, bitcoin is therefore scarce.
Pento apparenty had not done the simplest of research into bitcoin to understand this basic fact.
</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me what Pento could possibly mean when he says that bitcoins are destructible.
Possibly, Pento means that it is possible to lose your private keys.
Although it is true that if you lose your private keys then you will lose access to your bitcoins, the bitcoins are still there, just inaccessble.
This is analogous to storing your dollars or gold in a random location, and then forgetting where that location is, and then being unable to retrieve your dollars or gold.
However, the dollars, gold, or bitcoins are not destroyed in this case, just lost.
</p>

<p>Finally, Pento suggests that bitcoin is unnecessary because we already have gold, which is perfect money.
Besides the fact that gold has many minor flaws such as being hard to carry, store, and divide, gold also has a fundamenal flaw: it cannot be sent quickly over large distances, and is therefore inappropriate and obsolete in the age of information.
<a href="/archive/bitcoin-is-the-future-of-money-not-gold/">Bitcoin is superior to gold</a> because it can be sent instantly over large distances, on top of having the same or better as gold of all other monetary features (especially being limited in supply and divisible).
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.runtogold.com/2013/04/why-michael-pento-should-just-keep-his-mouth-shut/">Trace Mayer has a good article on Michael Pento's bitcoin stance</a>.
I&#8217;m not sure if Pento has taken another look at bitcoin since April, but hopefully, for his own sake, he will soon put more effort into understanding bitcoin so he can clear up his misconceptions and begin to take the future of money seriously.
Pento argues in &#8220;The Coming Bond Market Collapse&#8221; that the bond market is a bubble that will soon collapse, and even the dollar is a bubble that may soon collapse.
I completely agree with his assessment, but he has no appreciation of the <a href="/archive/bitcoin-will-catalyze-hyperinflation-of-the-dollar/">role that bitcoin will play in this coming catastrophe</a>.
If I&#8217;m right, bitcoin is the number one best way to hedge against the destruction of the fiat currency financial system and should be present in every portfolio.
