				<p>I can&#8217;t wait &#8217;til I have enough time to become a bread connoisseur. I&#8217;ll learn how to make breads that you&#8217;ve never heard of before, and I&#8217;ll become friends with all the bakers in my city and learn all the bread lingo. At first, I won&#8217;t understand why they like the breads they do. But over time I&#8217;ll learn, and after that I won&#8217;t eat store-bought bread anymore, even when store-bought bread tastes better and is generally more appropriate to the situation. My house will always smell like bread, and I&#8217;ll always bring bread to parties. And tell lots of bread jokes. When my wife says, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bed,&#8221; I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;what bread?&#8221; And I&#8217;ll teach my kids the lessons of life using bread metaphors. And when they, or anyone, ask for advice, I&#8217;ll relate it to bread somehow, whether I mean to or not. And when people say, &#8220;your fly is open,&#8221; I&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;what does that have to do with bread?&#8221; When I meet new people, I&#8217;ll ask them if they&#8217;ve ever tried [some specific kind of bread], it&#8217;s good. And when people tell me, &#8220;there&#8217;s more to life than bread,&#8221; I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;you&#8217;ve obviously never tried [some other specific kind of bread].&#8221; Until the day a tragic international bread accident happens, and I can&#8217;t ever face bread again, yes, it&#8217;ll be great to be a bread connoisseur.</p>
