In the bitcoin world, most ideas have already been had, but the ideas mean a lot less than the execution.
I&#8217;ve had two ideas that I executed poorly on that went on to be successful projects when the right person took the idea and ran with it:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://bitfunder.com/">BitFunder</a>: I purchased bitfunder.com in 2011 and began developing a crowdfunding website with a friend of mine.
However, when the great crash of 2011 struck, I didn&#8217;t have enough money to continue funding my idea, and the our project died.
I worked on other things and let the bitfunder.com domain name expire.
In 2012, some enterprising individuals purchased the bitfunder.com domain name and then went on to make an incredible, successful crowdfunding website with it.
I missed a great opportunity.

<p>
<a href="https://bitmessage.org/">Bitmessage</a>: In 2011 I developed the idea of a p2p communication network based on proof-of-work in order to have completely anonymous and secure communication.
It was called <a href="https://github.com/ryanxcharles/Proofnet">Proofnet</a>.
As with BitFunder, I ran out of incentive to continue working on the project, and let it languish.
In 2012, some enterprising individuals had a very similar idea and developed the now-successful Bitmessage, which is based on all the same principles.
Another great opportunity I missed.
</p>

<p>
Both BitFunder and Bitmessage are extraordinary, successful projects, and I wish the creators the best of luck.
These are examples of projects where I, and others, had the right idea, but only a small subset of those people both had the idea and executed.
