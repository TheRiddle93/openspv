					<p>I noticed a little man was watching me, so I said &#8220;Hello.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t seem to notice I had said anything at all. After a short while, he looked around and said, &#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;Yeah, you,&#8221; I said.</p>

					<p>&#8220;You can see me?&#8221; he said.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Yes, of course I can see you,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Why else would I say &#8216;Hello?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

					<p>He squinted at me in thought, and replied, &#8220;I dunno.&#8221;</p>
