				<p>I&#8217;m going to write a story called &#8220;The Mystery.&#8221; I can&#8217;t tell you any more about it because I don&#8217;t want to spoil the surprise. It may or may not involve characters, and I may or may not ever finish it. I may or may not delete this post in the future, and if I do, I will certainly deny that it ever existed.</p>
