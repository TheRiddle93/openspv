<p>Every &#8220;reasonable&#8221; investor will tell you not to hold more bitcoins than you can afford to lose, since bitcoin is a risky gamble that may mysteriously and magically become worthless at any moment.
Unfortunately this popular myth this is completely wrong, and it terrifies people about bitcoin for no good reason&#8212;even coming from the mouths of famous bitcoiners like <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2013/07/31/patrick-murck/true-value-bitcoin">Patrick Murck</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323809304578429142650304564.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_h">Gavin Andresen</a>.
</p>

<p>First of all, it is unlikely that bitcoin will become worthless, thanks to the <a href="/archive/the-forces-that-monetize-bitcoin/">forces that monetize bitcoin</a>.
These forces are,
</p>

<p>1) The unique featureset of bitcoin, which provides a base value upon which bitcoin can grow.</p>

<p>2) The network effect, which encourages users of bitcoin to proselytize for bitcoin, increasing demand further.</p>

<p>3) The first-mover advantage, which makes it unlikely any competitors will catch up with or overtake bitcoin.</p>

<p>4) The rational self-interest of bitcoiners, which in the event of any problems, ensures that these problems will be quickly fixed.</p>

<p>Instead of dropping to zero, bitcoin will probably continue to increase in value as more and more people adopt it, increasing demand, while the supply continues to remain limited.
</p>

<p>The price is not the only reason to hold bitcoin.
If you&#8217;re debating whether to hold bitcoin, ask yourself, what are you going to hold instead?
Fiat currencies are deeply flawed financial instruments that cannot last in the long-run.
If you have a lot of dollars stored in a checking account, this is not a good situation to be in.
The spectacular amount of money printing ensued by the Federal Reserve will likely end in hyperinflation.
Since bitcoin is strictly limited in supply, it can never be debased like the dollar, and is actually likely to increase in value, rather than guaranteed to decrease in value like the dollar.
That is on top of all the other advantages of bitcoin over the dollar, such as 1) Not being someone else&#8217;s liability, 2) Being cheaper to transmit over long distances than dollars, 3) Not being subject to account freezes of seizures.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, if bitcoin catches on, which it probably will, this will actually <a href="/archive/bitcoin-will-catalyze-hyperinflation-of-the-dollar/">imply the probable hyperinflation of the dollar</a>, completely independently of all the usual reasons the dollar is likely to suffer hyperinflation.
In that case, you will want to be sure you own as many bitcoins as possible, which will be worth more, and as few dollars as possible, which will be worth next to zero.
</p>

<p>How many bitcoins should you own?
Don&#8217;t listen to fear mongering from terrified and uncertain investors&#8212;use your own brain and do your own research.
If you thoroughly investigate bitcoin, then I think it is likely you will gradually arrive at the conclusion, as I have, that bitcoin will replace the dollar, and then you will increase your holdings of bitcoins and decrease your holdings of dollars in proportion to your certainty.
