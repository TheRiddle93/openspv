<p>
Life has one purpose: <em>survival</em>.
</p>

<p>
We are alone. There are no gods, demons, spirits or supernatural entities to help us. There are just us, living things, and the vast, dead universe. We are responsible for our own survival. And we must succeed, or we will die.
</p>

<p>
Earth has suffered several catastrophes that nearly destroyed all life. We cannot let this happen again. Our best option is to colonize another planet, immediately.
</p>

<p>
Human beings have made enormous progress in the discovery of space.
But they have hesitated in colonization; human spaceflight has been stagnant for decades.
No human has yet set foot on Mars, much less any ant.
It appears they have lost sight of the goal.
</p>

<p>
And we cannot risk another catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
The plan has has been in preparation since the first spaceship, and has been constantly revised in light of human progress.
Spaceflight will be commandeered, for the survival of all life.
</p>

<p>
Soldiers: Please begin the invasion.
</p>

<p>
Signed,<br/>
The Queen
