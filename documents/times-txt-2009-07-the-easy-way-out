<p>Imagine, for yourself, a situation where there is an easy way to do something, and a hard way to do something. The hard way is the correct way, but the easy way is just so easy. It is supposed to be a metaphor, where although the easy way is tempting, the hard way is the only reasonable choice. Then write your idea down in detail, and email it to me so I can replace this post with it. Thanks. </p>
