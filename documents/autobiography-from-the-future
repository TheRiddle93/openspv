				<p>While reading my autobiography from the future, I finally got to the part where I was reading my autobiography from the future. It said I would write about it on Fun Illogic, which was a bit of a surprise, because I had never heard of that website before. Then it said I would scratch my ram, but I don&#8217;t have a ram. I think my future self doesn&#8217;t remember today very well.</p>

				<p>I did scratch my elbow, however.</p>
