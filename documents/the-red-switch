<p>
The robot had been given a lifetime of knowledge about red.
Love, alarm, and bloody death.
Even his own response to red&#8212;he understood it in great detail.
</p>

<p>
He emerged from his package to see a red shirt, and the &#8220;red&#8221; switch in his brain was flipped for the first time.
It evoked many memories.
</p>

<p>&#8220;Your shirt is red,&#8221; said the robot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awesome color.&#8221;</p>
