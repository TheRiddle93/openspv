				<p>I walked past a man on the street today. He wore a cloak that covered his face, and I could not see who it was. When he passed, he grabbed me. I was startled, but I remained calm.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Ryan?&#8221; he asked, pulling the cloak down, revealing an old man&#8217;s face beneath.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I responded.</p>

				<p>&#8220;My God, it&#8217;s been years! So many years!&#8221;</p>

				

				<p>Who was this cloaked man? How could he possibly know my name? I did not recognize his face, and I don&#8217;t know anyone that wears a cloak. &#8220;God?&#8221; I asked.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly! Don&#8217;t you recognize me, Ryan? I am Gregory, your brother! Your long lost brother!&#8221;</p>

				<p>This man was at least eighty years older than me. Maybe he meant brother in friendly sense.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I am your blood brother and we share the same mother! Don&#8217;t you remember me, Ryan?&#8221; He threw his cane aside and hugged me. I didn&#8217;t hug back. &#8220;It&#8217;s been so long! I love you, brother,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;You wanna go get some McDonalds?&#8221; Yeah, and lemme guess, you left your wallet at home.</p>

				

				<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you are my brother,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You must be at least eighty years older than me.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;That would make you fifty, and you look a lot younger than that.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;That just proves my point even more.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yeah, I had a feeling you weren&#8217;t my brother. Let&#8217;s make a deal. You give me fifty dollars right now, and we forget this ever happened.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; I said. &#8220;Maybe if I was a rich person!&#8221;</p>

				

				<p>&#8220;Gosh, this always happens. I guess I&#8217;ll see ya later, man.&#8221; He held up his hand and waited. I gave him a high five.</p>

				<p>&#8220;See ya,&#8221; I said.</p>
