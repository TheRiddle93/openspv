				<p>A friend once said to me, &#8220;Hey. What&#8217;s up?&#8221; It seemed appropriate at the time. I guess you had to be there.</p>

	<p>The same friend is also responsible for saying &#8220;Hello,&#8221; but that&#8217;s completely unrelated. He wasn&#8217;t my friend for long after that. Let&#8217;s just say I killed him.
