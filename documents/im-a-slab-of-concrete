				<p>If I were a slab of concrete, I would definitely tell the other slabs that sledgehammers &#8220;crack me up,&#8221; and then go, &#8220;ba-doom, cha!&#8221; as if I had just played a little beat on some drums. Then I would begin to cry, as if I had been reminded of times past, when I was happier.</p>
