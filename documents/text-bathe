				<p>I was twenty four and with child when I took my first bath. Of course I cried like a twenty year old, but my mother wouldn&#8217;t let me get out until my fetus was clean. It was marvelous. In fact it felt so good, that I decided that I would have to take another bath in a few weeks. Since then I&#8217;ve been on a once-a-week routine, and I have taken over two hundred and fifty baths. I am definitely going to bathe my child at some point, perhaps at an earlier age than my mother did for me. Say twenty three.
