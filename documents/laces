				<p>About twice a day someone will point out that my shoes are untied. For years I would respond kindly, thanking them, then limping away quickly as if I were going to tie them immediately. Then I went through a hateful period, where I would respond by saying, for example, &#8220;and you forgot to take off your ugly mask. Tie that, boot licker.&#8221; But nowadays I just tell them the truth, that I never learned how to tie my shoes. Sometimes they don&#8217;t understand, or express shock, as if everybody learns how to tie their shoes when they&#8217;re young. Sometimes they offer to help tie my shoes for me, or to teach me how to do it myself. Of course I don&#8217;t let them, I&#8217;m too proud for that. But a select few will actually respond with some understanding, or tell me about those in their life who never learned how to zip their pants, or use a fork. These are usually the people with an appreciation of modern sociological issues. They realize that one in three American adults never learned how to tie their shoes. Like me.</p>

	<p>About every third day I will trip on my laces and fall on my face. It doesn&#8217;t even hurt anymore.
