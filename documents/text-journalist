				<p>I think if I were a journalist writing about a vigilante named Steven Justice, I&#8217;d title my article &#8220;Steven Justice Has Been Served,&#8221; or something equally clever. That assumes there is something equally clever, which there isn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the exact title I would use. Or maybe &#8220;Steven The Vigilante,&#8221; but that&#8217;s not quite as clever, which pretty much proves my earlier point that I had already determined the cleverist title for such an article.</p>
