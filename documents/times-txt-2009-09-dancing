<p>So I was nude break dancing on the corner with Daft Punk on loudspeaker, just like I do every Sunday morning, when a woman started staring at me from across the street. Seriously, she just stared for a good 10 minutes. Why do people have to be so weird? Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m dancing?</p>

<p>Anyway, she joined the fun eventually. That broke the tension.</p>
