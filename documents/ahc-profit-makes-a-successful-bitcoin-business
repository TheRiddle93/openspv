<p>The most successful bitcoin business is probably <a href="http://www.mtgox.com/">Mt. Gox</a>, the largest bitcoin exchange.
They make a profit by charging 0.65% on every trade.
I intend to start my own bitcoin business, and I&#8217;m concerned about what will make a successful one.
One key to remember, I think (take my opinion for what it&#8217;s worth, considering I don&#8217;t actually have a successful bitcoin business yet), is that bitcoin businesses must be profitable.
This might sound obvious, except that a lot of USD businesses are able to &#8220;succeed&#8221; not by profiting, but by constantly getting new money in the form of investments and loans.
Many businesses can survive for many years this way.
This is possible because the financial industry constantly creates new money, and thus there is always new money to invest and to loan out.
It is a sort of Ponzi scheme and financial scam.
But this is not possible with bitcoin.
So businesses will have to rely on old-fashioned profit in order to survive.
(It is also interesting to note that because bitcoin will basically always increase in value, a business will be &#8220;profitable&#8221; if it can maintain its bitcoin reserves or only slightly lower them with time.)
