				<p>I woke up at exactly 6:49, put on a pot of coffee, and hopped in the shower. Just like I did every day when I was seven. I rode the bus to school, walked to class without talking to anyone, and read silently after class began. Recess came and I played soccer. One of the kids kicked the ball out of bounds, so I ran after it. I followed it over a hill, around a tree, and into the woods. And there stood a demon, with the ball in his hands.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Is this your ball?&#8221; asked the demon, in a surprisingly friendly voice.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; I politely responded.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Would you like to have it back?&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Yes, please.&#8221;</p>

				<p>The demon smiled. &#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll give it back to you if you&#8217;ll do something for me.&#8221; I stared at him without saying anything. &#8220;See that cliff over there? Run back and tell your little friends you can&#8217;t find the ball, and bring one of them back to help you look for it. When you reach the cliff, push him off.&#8221; He smiled.</p>

				<p>&#8220;I have a question,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Suppose I don&#8217;t go back to get one of my friends, and instead I choose to kick your ass right here, right now?&#8221;</p>

				<p>His smiled disappeared. &#8220;Then so be it.&#8221; He dropped the ball, and pulled out his pitch-fork. I ran forward with all my speed, and kicked the ball at his crotch. My shot was dead-on, and he puked instantaneously, falling to his knees.</p>

				<p>I grabbed the pitch-fork and held it to his throat. &#8220;You better not try something like that again,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Or next time I won&#8217;t be so nice.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I casually walked back to the field with the ball under my arm and a pitch-fork in my hand. Interestingly, no one asked about the pitch-fork. When I got home that day, I put the pitch-fork in my closet, and there it remains to this day. Late at night, when it&#8217;s dark, you can see a faint red glow from underneath my closet door.</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t wait to tell you about the third most interesting day of my life.</p>
