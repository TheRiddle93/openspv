				<p>&#8220;Human beings have free will,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Oh yeah?&#8221; she said, emphatically, as if she had been insulted. The male didn&#8217;t look very surprised. The female then grabbed an ice pick from the male&#8217;s desk and began to stab him, shouting, &#8220;How do you like them apples?&#8221; with each blow. She occassionally mixed it up a bit and said &#8220;How do you like them apples, bitch?&#8221;</p>

				<p>The female then began to frantically look around the office, letting her stabbing motions slow a bit while her attention was diverted. Eventually she spotted a bushel of apples near the lounge. She walked over to the apples, while breathing heavily and fixing her hair with her least bloody hand (and holding the ice pick in the other). She then began to eat one of the apples.</p>

				<p>With eyes wide open, the female then asked, &#8220;Now who&#8217;s got the free will?&#8221; This must have been a rhetorical question, since the male was dead, and none of the others were paying attention.</p>
