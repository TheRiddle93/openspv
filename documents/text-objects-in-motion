				<p>I have noticed that when I drive in my car, I can throw a ball straight up, and it will fall straight back down into my hand, even though I am driving at a high speed with respect to the ground. But when I hold my hand out of the window and attempt the same experiment, the ball will fly away. It is as if objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by wind. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this.</p>
