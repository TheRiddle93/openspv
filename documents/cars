				<p>If I could go back to 1904, I would dis cars. &#8220;They&#8217;ll never make it,&#8221; I would say. Then I would buy one, and invest in Ford. When people ask why I&#8217;m being so hypocritical, I&#8217;d tell them to shut up and stop being stupid. &#8220;Wake up and smell the coffee,&#8221; I&#8217;d say, whilst hitting them.</p>

				<p>And then I would travel back to the future and sell my stock.</p>
