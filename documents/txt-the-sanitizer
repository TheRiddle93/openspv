				<p>My room wasn&#8217;t that bad. It wouldn&#8217;t have taken more than a couple of minutes to clean, but I went to bed anyway.</p>

				<p>A few minutes later I heard my mother screaming from the living room. She was being beat senseless by the Sanitizer.</p>

				<p>The next morning I found my mother shivering in the corner, naked and crying. She had a message painted on her back: &#8220;Little children should clean their rooms before bedtime or their parents will be punished.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;Now can I have a cell phone, mom?&#8221; I said. &#8220;I hope so, or I won&#8217;t be cleaning my room again tonight.&#8221; I then packed my lunch and headed off to school.<p>

				<p>At first I didn&#8217;t like living in a Sanitized community, but I have changed my mind.<p>
