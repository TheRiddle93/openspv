<p>&#8220;You have ten insults,&#8221; said the Equalizer. &#8220;If you do not use your insults by the 31st day of December in the year following your 25th birthday, I will cut you in half with the Axe of Equality.&#8221;</p>



<p>He raised the axe to his side, but the students remained quiet. One student began to ingest his own nasal mucus.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps you should tell the students what you do for fun,&#8221; said Mrs. Greene.</p>



<p>&#8220;For fun?&#8221; said the Equalizer.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you do when you&#8217;re not working?&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am always working,&#8221; he said, loudly projecting his voice across the classroom. &#8220;I continuously prepare for the Celebration of Equality by taking the lives of a thousand prostitutes per day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Excellent work ethic,&#8221; said Mrs. Greene, blushing.</p>



<p>One student raised her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;How do you kill so many people in one day?&#8221; she said. &#8220;There are a lot of nice people who don&#8217;t use all of their insults.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I use my axe,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, the world is so big,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And there are so many people. How do you kill them all?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; said one of the boys. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is not impossible,&#8221; said the Equalizer. &#8220;Just ask your teacher.&#8221;</p>



<p>The children looked at Mrs. Greene; she had been cut in two. Her top half toppled over, and her bottom half collapsed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Awesome!&#8221; said the children. &#8220;That was so fast!&#8221; said one of the boys, who had temporarily stopped ingesting his own nasal mucus.</p>



<p>The blood of Mrs. Greene dripped from the blade of the axe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, who hates their music teacher?&#8221; said the Equalizer.</p>



<p>The children laughed. &#8220;She&#8217;s a whore!&#8221; they said.</p>
