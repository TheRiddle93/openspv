				<p>I used to have a notebook that I would use to record good ideas. For example, &#8220;the wheel,&#8221; or &#8220;the electrical outlet next to the door in my parents&#8217; basement,&#8221; or &#8220;doing things other than writing things in this notebook.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to find it back, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
