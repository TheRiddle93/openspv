<p>I was pissing with my hands tied behind my back, as usual, when a gigantic man-sized spider opened the door and started watching me. With my phallus occupied, and my hands tied behind my back, I had no means to close the door. I had two options. I could let the gigantic man-sized spider continue to watch me, or I could pee on him. Since you know me as well as you do, you can probably guess which option I chose. I let him watch me.</p>

<p>When I was done, he untied my hands, gave me a twenty, and jumped out the window. He&#8217;s been over a few times since then, but we usually just get wasted and watch the presidential debates on repeat. Them two are such loons.</p>
