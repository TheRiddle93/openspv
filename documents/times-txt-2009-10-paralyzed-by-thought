<p>
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get some work done?&#8221; I said.

<p>
She just sat there staring at the wall.
I&#8217;d seen this before.
I knew she would respond eventually.
</p>

<p>
3 hours later, she said something.
</p>

<p>
&#8220;I&#8217;m making intellectual progress,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;This is far more effective than actual work.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8220;Then why did you quit now?&#8221; I said.
</p>

<p>
&#8220;Segfault,&#8221; she said.
</p>

<p>
I was tempted to make fun of her for not actually getting anything done, but then again I had just been standing there waiting for her to respond for 3 hours.
I wouldn&#8217;t want to sound like a hypocrite.
</p>

<p>
&#8220;Did you save?&#8221; I said.
</p>

<p>
No use. She was already paralyzed by thought again.
