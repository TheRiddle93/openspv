<p>The United States is a &#8220;representative democracy,&#8221; which basically means we vote for representatives who then vote for legislation.
Our representatives, who are human, are supposed to represent out interests.
This is a deeply flawed system, because our representatives have their own interests.
Their interests may overlap with ours a lot, but they will never have identical interests to our own.
Thus, since they have the power, their interests will win whenever their interests conflict with ours.
But if we don&#8217;t have representatives, how ought we structure our society?
By merely recognizing that we already are our own representatives, we merely have to act in our own best interest.
The system that emerges from this is the most democratic.
Not democratic in the sense of having everyone <a href="ahc/voting-has-no-causal-influence-on-the-outcome">vote</a>, but democratic in the sense of everyone having a say in what happens.
Just don&#8217;t be brainwashed into serving somebody else&#8217;s interests.
Serve your own.
