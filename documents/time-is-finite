<p>The following two claims are true:</p>

<ul>
<li>The universe is 13.7 billion years old.</li>
<li>The universe has always existed.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem that these two claims contradict one other, but they don&#8217;t if you recognize that time is finite.
The universe has existed for all time, and therefore the universe has always existed.
The only reason to think that these claims contradict one another is if you assume that time is infinite.
But all the evidence says otherwise.
Time is finite.
