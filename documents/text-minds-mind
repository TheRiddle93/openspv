				<p>While writing this post, I briefly wondered if it was a useful waste of time, so I stepped into my mind&#8217;s mind to be sure. I noticed that my mind looked a little moldy from there, but my mind&#8217;s mind&#8217;s mind said it was just a problem with my mind&#8217;s mind&#8217;s visual cortex and it shouldn&#8217;t affect the post at all. So I hit submit and fell into my mind&#8217;s body for some rest. That dude is ignorant but frankly I&#8217;d rather not think about it right now.</p>
