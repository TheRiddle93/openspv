<p>&#8220;What does this sound like?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like red,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; she said. Then she doubled the frequency. &#8220;And this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like purple,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Then she doubled the frequency again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weeeeeeeeeeeeeird,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I want you to tell me how you feel when you hear each color,&#8221; she said. She turned down the frequency, and turned up the volume.</p>

<p>First red.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel alarmed,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then purple.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel peaceful,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then the trigger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to watch people. Understand their lives. Learn their pattern. Then kill them and eat them and do it over again and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat them?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think we got a better brain enhancer than we bargained for.&#8221;</p>
