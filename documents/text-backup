				<p>&#8220;What happened to you?&#8221; I said. &#8220;You look five years younger.&#8221;</p>

				<p>&#8220;I died and had to revert to a backup,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Damn, you need to backup more often,&#8221; I said.</p>

				<p>&#8220;No fucking kidding, dumbass,&#8221; he said, while forcefully moving his head from side to side. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fucking think I know that by now?&#8221;</p>

				<p>I then stabbed him in the heart with an ice pick (I&#8217;m too cheap to buy a blender, but I really love chopped ice). I hope he hadn&#8217;t already made another backup, because I would really enjoy killing him again tomorrow.</p>
