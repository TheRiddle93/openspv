				<p>My power has been out for the past sixty-eight days. This is a lie, but bear with me. I&#8217;ve adapated to a simpler life, and it&#8217;s not as bad as I might have expected. My garden vegetables taste great. My pigs love me. The heater doesn&#8217;t work, but I&#8217;ve knitted a few dozen blankets to keep myself warm. A lack of power is the best thing that has ever happened to me.</p>

	<p>I told my pigs if the power ever comes back on, I&#8217;m going to eat them. That keeps them in line.</p>
