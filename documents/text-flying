				<p>It was a long day, and I had been eating mushrooms. The kind that doesn&#8217;t cause hallucinations.</p>

	<p>I grabbed my feet and yanked&#8212;lo and behold, I was propelled upward. I had achieved flight. After a while, I settled back down to Earth, and ate some more mushrooms. I love mushrooms.</p>

	<p>Seriously, not the kind causes hallucinations. Although I&#8217;d be willing to give them a chance.</p>

	<p>I flew home, took a nap, and did some homework. Little did I know, the next day would be almost exactly the opposite.</p>
