<p>Sometimes people ask why they would bother paying for something on the internet with bitcoins rather than credit cards or Paypal.
One reason is privacy&#8212;since with bitcoin no third party knows about your transaction&#8212;but most people don&#8217;t care about privacy.
The answer is that some merchants will only accept bitcoins, and thus customers will need to pay with bitcoins.
The reason for this is that accepting bitcoins over the internet is technologically as easy as accepting anything else, except that you don&#8217;t have to deal with any third parties, so on the whole it is easier.
Further, it is safer for the merchant, because no one can charge back bitcoins.
Thus, customers will adopt bitcoin so that they can buy stuff from the merchants that accept it.
