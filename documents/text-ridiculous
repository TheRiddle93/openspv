				<p>I think my new thing will be to tell people not to be ridiculous. &#8220;I am going to eat a bologna sandwich,&#8221; someone will say. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous,&#8221; I will tell them. Or maybe they will ask for a favor, but I won&#8217;t need to tell them they&#8217;re being ridiculous then. But maybe they&#8217;ll tell me I&#8217;m being ridiculous, in which case I&#8217;ll repeatedly tell them &#8220;your mom&#8221; until they ask someone else.</p>
