I believe there is a deep problem with the way our system of education works in the United States (and, from what I can gather, pretty much everywhere else): there is a bizarre assumption that the responsibility for education lies in the hands of some authorities (teachers, administrators, parents, the president, etc.) rather than the students.
But the interests of the authorities are never going to be perfectly aligned with the students, and thus the students find themselves being forced to waste their time acquiring valueless knowledge which benefits the authorities rather than the students.
We should recognize that, contrary to popular assumption, the students are the ones who are actually responsible for their own education.
If older people want to do anything to help, they should provide opportunities and resources to the students.
But no one should be forcing the students to do anything.

<p><a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2011/08/19/miller_essay_on_how_faculty_should_get_out_before_higher_education_collapses">Like some others</a>, I think this system is going to come to an end (not just higher education, but formal education at all levels), for the simple reason that economic pressure will demand it.
Let&#8217;s embrace the collapse.
It may sound catastrophic, but it will actually be much better.
The collapse is the collapse of a broken system, not a successful one.
Finally, young people will be freed to take matters into their own hands.
And the rest of us will benefit from their contributions.
