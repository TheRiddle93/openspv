<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> is a decentralized digital currency that derives value from at least two principles:
1) It is impossible for anyone to print new bitcoins (without mining, which is computationally challenging).
2) It is very easy to transmit bitcoins across the internet.
Gold has the first property&#8212;that it can't be created out of thin air&#8212;and that is part of why gold is so valuable.
But you can't send gold over the internet.
Bitcoins, however, you can.
And like gold, there is a finite total amount (21 million coins), and is divisible to as small of quantities as we will ever need.
Bitcoin is to the internet what gold is to land.
</p>

<p>
Also like gold, bitcoin has intrinsic value: it is cool.
The coolness factor, along with a great deal of speculation, has allowed bitcoin to catch on, at least a little bit.
Multiplying the present number of bitcoins by the present exchange rate gives a value of about 50 million dollars; much greater than worthless.
But it has not reached anywhere near its potential, which is as the defacto internet currency.
That will only happen when, and if, it has a stable and growing economy with diverse businesses.
And that economy is only just getting started, because most obvious bitcoin businesses do not yet exist.
For instance, there is no bitcoin bank.
</p>

<p>
For entrepreneurs, we thus see there is an algorithm for creating bitcoin businesses: List existing bitcoin businesses, and then list existing non-bitcoin businesses, and see which businesses are only in the non-bitcoin category.
Then, create those businesses for bitcoin.
You do not have to be clever to employ this algorithm; you just have to work hard.
</p>

<p>
So long as your business is solid, it will scale with the bitcoin economy.
But naturally, any bitcoin businesses are going to be entirely dependent on the success of bitcoin.
If bitcoin succeeds, you can ride the bitcoin wave.
But if it fails, you will fail with it.
So as entrepreneurs, we ask: should be put our energy into bitcoin?
I think the answer is yes, for these reasons:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Bitcoin will probably succeed in some form or another.</strong> Bitcoin is as secure as it could be at this point in the history of cryptography, the community is devoted and growing, and there are no reasonable competitors.
If it is possible to create a successful, classical (not quantum) cryptocurrency, bitcoin is it.
Even with all this, it may yet fail.
Personally, I give failure the somewhat low but still significant probability of 25%.
But of course, any individual will have to asses this probability themselves.
According to my estimation, there is a 75% probability of success, which is good enough for me.
Even a 10% probability of success would be good enough given the likely size of bitcoin if it succeeds.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2. If it succeeds, it will probably be huge.</strong> I am not aware of a recent technology so widely useful except for the web, the internet or computing itself.
If you create a big bitcoin business, and bitcoin itself becomes big, your business will be big squared.
What Google is to search, your business could be to digital currency.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. There is almost no competition.</strong> Since most obvious bitcoin businesses do not yet exist, you can straightforwardly monopolize any segment of the bitcoin economy by creating a really solid business.
The first bitcoin bank will probably do this; why have another bank, if the first one is excellent?
<a href="https://mtgox.com/">Mt. Gox</a> has already done this for bitcoin exchange.
</p>

<p>
<strong>4. It has never been easier to start so small and get so big.</strong> Businesses that already sell products or services can simply start accepting bitcoin, and then profit enormously if bitcoin succeeds.
And new businesses that offer services will need as little as a functional website to be profitable, which we all know can sometimes be created with as little as a day of effort.
As the most obvious bitcoin businesses get created, these low-hanging fruits will be snatched.
</p>

<p>
A year or so from now, we will know if bitcoin has succeeded or not.
If the bitcoin economy has grown significantly, and shows no signs of stopping, and has survived all attacks up to that point, then it has succeeded.
The momentum will surely be impossible to stop at that point.
But if it falls victim to an attack and its value has plummeted, then it has failed.
Waiting to know with certainty whether bitcoin will succeed or not will only ensure you miss the present opportunity.
By next year, all the easiest, obvious businesses will be taken, and entering the bitcoin economy will be much harder and less profitable.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin is not a guarantee.
But neither was the internet, computing, or any other disruptive technology.
Personally, I am investing with every coin of entrepreneurship I can spend or borrow.
