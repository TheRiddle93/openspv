## Plan

- "Own your data" messenger - business model is take 30% of targeted ads to
  users.
- Must be based on paymail and be decentralized in the sense that anyone can run
  a node. Log in with your paymail.
- The consumer version is free, but we take 30% of targeted ads
- I will also license a commercial version for businesses to run their own

Principles:

- Bootstrap. Do not raise money. Earn money on Day 1.
- Collect KYC information on Day 1. All relationships (customers, employees,
  partners) must satisfy a list of moral requirements including not to lie.

Consumers:

- Invite-based growth.
- KYC of every user.
- Charge enough to more than fund KYC.
- Backup Buddy built-in at the start.
- "Login-based" model, different from MB. Always open a popup to log in to
  third-party website. (Avoids Safari/privacy issues).
- No stripe. No MB. All payments come from invites (give $100 to friend) or
  "receive at paymail".
- Verified email is a requirement. All messages go to email.

Businesses:

- Entire software can be hosted by any business.
- $10,000 per month.
- Everything is closed-source by default and I will selectively open-source some
  parts after launching it for sale, e.g. Open SPV.

Patents:

- Build and launch first.
- Then patent immediately after launch.

Non-compete agreement:

- Figure out the best business first.
- Then figure out the best way to deal with the non-compete before launching
  each revenue-generating product.

Post-MVP:

- Selling content will be a feature. I will sell content through the app. Each
  user will have a page.
- The software itself will be sold using the software.

Compliance:

- Have an AML policy. Have an anti-terrorism policy.
- Be an "unhosted wallet" only until we are ready to comply with hosted wallet
  regulations.
- Collect KYC/KYB information including country, verified name, verified
  government ID.
- Prohibit sanctioned countries:  Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, Sudan,
  Syria, North Korea.
- Prohibit sanctioned countries based on verified data, IP, email.
- Comply with the travel rule - send customer data to receiving wallet

## Launch Plan

- Email sign up (with verification)
- KYC (with $5.00 payment for ~ $1.25 cost per verification)
- Upload avatar + description
- Show documentation if you are signed in (and have therefore paid $5.00 + KYC)
- Coasian SPV
- Coasian Forth
- Coasian Messenger
- Earn money for viewing ads
- invitation affiliate system

## Terms of Relationship

Lying is always unacceptable. White lies are lies. If you feel compelled to lie,
it is better not to say anything at all rather than to lie. If you are caught
lying, you will be permanently banned from Coasian and your money will not be
refunded.
