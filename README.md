================

This is the source code for ryanxcharles.com. Contains documents in raw form and the node.js code I wrote to compile the documents. The website is static with no dynamic content at all.

Technologies used are:
* node.js
* ejs (embedded js)
* Twitter Bootstrap
* express (for development preview)
* json-header (a document format - see my other repo named json-header)
