MVP:
- "Ten Years of Bitcoin"
- Posted on May 13, 2021.
- Free preview. An entire share-able article that is compelling and
  share-worthy. Has social media sharing links.
- For-pay continued article behind a $100 pay wall. Worth paying for. Genuinely
  worth $100. Users are convinced to pay after reading the compelling free
  article above. Users are happy they paid and excited to share the article
  with others.
- Sell the article to at least 10,000 people by the end of May.
- Users must give paymail and email to purchase the article. They go into a
  user registration system that I will expand on later. Email unsubscribe is
  built in on Day 1.
- Users must agree never to lie, not even white lies, in order to purchase the
  article. They agree that if they ever lie, they can be permanently banned and
  their money will not be refunded.
- There is an affiliate system where users can earn 30% for linking the article
  to a paying reader. You can only be an affiliate if you have already paid for
  the article. Not multi-level. You are already incentivized to share the
  article with people who also share the article because you get 30% when they
  buy it.
- Allow people to buy the article *for others*. That way people who don't have
  the money can still read the article.

Marketing:
- Video on YouTube.
- Tweet.
- Natural virality of affiliate model.
- Buy ads on Facebook/Google? This would almost certainly need Stripe
  integration - MB for affiliate links, and Stripe for Facebook/Google by
  default?
- Buy the article for a friend.

Spiritual goal:
- Believe that I can sell this article to 10,000 people by the end of May.

Future articles:
- The Hero with a Thousand Bitcoins
