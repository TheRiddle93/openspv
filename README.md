## Plan

- "Own your data" messenger - business model is take 30% of targeted ads to
  users.
- Must be based on paymail and be decentralized in the sense that anyone can run a node.
- The consumer version is free, but we take 30% of targeted ads
- The messenger is for consumers, but I will also license a commercial version
  for businesses to run their own

Principles:

- Bootstrap. Do not raise money. Earn money on Day 1.
- Collect KYC information on Day 1. All relationships (customers, employees,
  partners) must satisfy a list of moral requirements.

Consumers:

- Invite-based growth.
- KYC of every user.
- Charge enough to more than fund KYC.
- Backup Buddy built-in at the start.
- "Login-based" model, different from MB. Always open a popup to log in to
  third-party website. (Avoids Safari/privacy issues).
- No stripe. No MB. All payments come from invites (give $100 to friend) or
  "receive at paymail".
- Verified email is a requirement. All messages go to email.

Businesses:

- Entire software can be hosted by any business.
- $10,000 per month.
- Everything is closed-source by default and I will selectively open-source some
  parts after launching it for sale, e.g. Open SPV.

Patents:

- Build and launch first.
- Then patent immediately after launch.

Non-compete agreement:

- Figure out the best business first.
- Then figure out the best way to deal with the non-compete before launching
  each revenue-generating product.

Post-MVP:

- Selling content will be a feature. I will sell content through the app. Each
  user will have a page.
- The software itself will be sold using the software.
